last week it was really warm, it was in the 70's. now it is back down in the 30's. my dad left for india yesterday to visit his family. he asked if i wanted anything from there and i asked if he could get this [kajal](https://www.lakmeindia.com/products/lakme-9-to-5-eyeconic-kajal). i can't find it the us, and even if i did, it would be $5-$10 (there is one on ebay for $14 and it doesn't even ship to the us!!!!!!!!!!!) instead of $2 (₹179). it is a really good eyeliner. 

we went on saturday to fix some bubbles in my tint. it's been about a month since we've bought the car, and the bubbles weren't gone. there was a small bubble on the back window, and the salesman said we could leave it or re-tint it. my dad decided it would be best to re-tint it.

i'm a redundant writer. when i proof read anything, there's always a part where i say the same thing twice in the same sentence.

i haven't been chatty, i'm sorry. my mind is blank. every morning i think, "yes, today i am going to skip school" but i can never bring myself to actually do it. i'm exhausted. winter break is the week after next week. i'll probably be getting my wisdom teeth removed. 

this winter break, i actually want to do stuff. i don't even have an excuse for doing nothing this time around. i found a bunch of new baking recipes to try to make, and i have a knitting pattern i'm set on making. i've yet to buy the yarn or hooks, but i live very close to michael's and hobby lobby, in fact hobby lobby is on the way home from my school!!!

three entries in a row at the same time! 

i've finished the first half of *the road* by mccarthy and its been a journey. this is one of the first books i've read by him, so it took a while to adjust to his writing style, especially his lack of punctuation. at first i hated it, but as i've gotten through more of the book, i think it adds a lot to the atmosphere. the rushed pacing matches the fast paced environment of the book, as when you're in the apocalypse, you wouldn't be stopping to admire the scenery. i still don't like how he doesn't use quotation marks, i think those should be added, as i personally find it hard to discern who's talking or not, especially in a paragraph. he doesn't do this too often though, so it's just a little quirk i suppose. i'm reading this for english class book club, and for the first time reading it in class i was behind. but last class yesterday, i was way ahead ahahahahaha.

my friend H also got me a birthday gift. she gave me a super fluffy rabbit plush and a fish(!!!!!) keychain. on her birthday, i kissed her birthday card with red lipstick and she kissed mine too. i lover her so much, she's my best and my closest friend. 

i'm going to try to meal prep this weekend for lunch specifically. i don't like when my stomach grumbles in the middle of class, i don't like eating multiple small snacks through the day. i have these [chicken caesar wraps](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a64892069/easy-chicken-caesar-wrap-recipe/) that i want to try to make. i might just buy torilla's and stuff them with turkey meat though, but i'll try to make chicken ones.

it has been really cold lately. i don't really like it. i'm waking up cold in the morning, which causes me to not want to get up. i think it makes me sick too, as this morning i had the most excruciating nausea, thought i'm not sure how to fully describe what i felt. it also might (definitely) be because of dehydration and sleep deprivation. i needed to work on an english assignment but genuinely don't know how she expects us to do this stuff, there's literally no instructions whatsoever, i'm kinda banking on the rest of my class not doing the assignment either, i hope that's the case. otherwise i am done for. i don't know why writing assignments are so difficult for me now. it was hard last year, but my god, i can't even sit here and write for myself without having to zone out halfway through. i was writing a tutorial a few weeks ago and i've scrapped it because i genuinely had no idea what i was doing. 13 yo me would be ashamed. it could be a combination of things, i don't have a very good diet, and i get tired easily. i try to eat healthy, or at the very least eat at home. surprisingly this pisses off my mom, i guess she just doesn't want to do dishes. hopefully when i move out, i'll be able to eat better. i really hate where i'm sitting right now, the same place as yesterday. there are obnoxious boys that are too close to me oh my god you have the whole hall why are you towering over me right now i'm about to scream. all of this because the library doesn't want to open. i hate it here. but apparently this school is top 100 of some best high school ranking. what a joke.

i spent last week pretty much doing nothing. i couldn't bring myself to do much of anything. i really just sat around on my bed. i couldn't even crochet, i only made a measly bookmark and a frogged multiple projects. i didn't go out with my friends, since they were either busy or out of town for thanksgiving. i did however learn how to make pancakes, so i ate those for 5/7 days of my break for breakfast. i also went to go clothes shopping with my parents, i bought a really pretty brown dress for my birthday, two pairs of jeans, and three tops. it was black friday deal, so it didn't end up being that costly (it was still expensive though eheheh).
    
when my birthday came around on, i spent it with my family. we had lunch at olive garden where the waiters sang to me because my parents wanted free cake. they pronounced my name wrong, but i'm not mad about it. when i was there, i saw these two really pretty girls. my mom's friend came to my house to give me pink roses and a gift card. after that i took some photos with the dress i had bought a day prior. i took them on my digital camera and my mom's phone. i posed with the flowers my mom's friend had bought me and they turned out really good. my and family then went out for dinner and came home at around 21:30. overall, it was a pretty good day. 

as i'm writing this, i'm sitting the same lunch spot i used to sit it as a freshman, in front of the gym door tucked away in a corner (a sign next to me almost fell on my as i was writing this!!!!!). the freshman boys next to me are disgusting and there is a very pretty woman in front of me. it is surprising how i still have the same reactions to the same situations, even from 4 years.
