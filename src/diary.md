yesterday was a really good day! my friend H came over to crochet together. i taught her how to make a star and a heart. we were able to talk and it was nice. she recently got into a relationship and—to the dismay of 12yo me—i love hearing about romance. i'm really happy she's found a such a sweet and good guy, she deserves nothing less than the best. 

we also went to a mutual friend of ours uncles sushi place where i tried sushi for the first time. we ordered an all you can eat, so i tried a lot of new things. i had a eel and cucumber roll as well as a smoked salmon one. i really enjoyed them both! they had a super good sweet eel sauce topped on all the rolls, which was my favorite. i also tried some chicken tempura. i tried sashimi for the first time and hated it. it's something you need to get used to, but i don't think thats going to happen any time soon. at the end, we had tempura fried oreo's with chocolate sauce and whipped cream which was, as expected, absolutely delicious.

been meaning to write something, but i haven't been able to formulate it properly. i guess i'll start with what i did over the break. 

i mostly lied down, partly because of my sedentary nature, but also because i got my wisdom teeth removed. i wrote an entry about it last month. it didn't hurt for too long, thanks to the pain meds. though now i have holes in my gums, and i sometimes run over them with my tongue on accident and it grosses me out. i also managed to crochet some [pieces](/crochet/). i also cooked some [food](/cooking/) for the first time in a while and [baked](/baking/). i also did some sewing again. my dad wanted me to repair his [patka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patka). i also removed the elastic from my old pair of joggers out of sheer boredom. i didn't knit, but i think i made up for that fact. i didn't see many people, but i had dinner and went shopping with a mutual friend of mine. it was nice to talk to her, i want to get closer to her but i'm not really sure how. overall, i think this break was a lot more productive than my last one. 

i usually get a rush of ambition when the new year comes. like last year, when i was sure to change my whole life around. that didn't happen, obviously. i'm sure i've changed in way that i can't tell, but it doesn't really matter. if i can't notice it, it must be insignificant. if anything, i feel i've gained more problems and stress, when last year was meant to reduce that! i guess it's a part of aging. 

this year, i don't know what i want. i've rewritten this 3 times already to try to convey what i want for this year but i genuinely don't know. i'm not as ambitious as i used to be. is that a bad thing or a good thing? on one had, i appear lazy and unmotivated to people, but on the other, i can avoid disappointment and unnecessary stress about any goals i might have had. 

right now, i'm getting back into sewing. i'm going to try and make a small tote bag for myself. i've also started working on a web-shrine for [luka](/shrines/lukashrine/luka.html). i've never made one before, so it's proving to be challenging, but also fun. i've also applied for 1 job. on the weekend, me and H are going to have a crochet date and we might also be cooking something together. i'm really looking forward to it!
