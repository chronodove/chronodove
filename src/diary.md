it has been really cold lately. i don't really like it. i'm waking up cold in the morning, which causes me to not want to get up. i think it makes me sick too, as this morning i had the most excruciating nausea, thought i'm not sure how to fully describe what i felt. it also might (definitely) be because of dehydration and sleep deprivation. i needed to work on an english assignment but genuinely don't know how she expects us to do this stuff, there's literally no instructions whatsoever, i'm kinda banking on the rest of my class not doing the assignment either, i hope that's the case. otherwise i am done for. i don't know why writing assignments are so difficult for me now. it was hard last year, but my god, i can't even sit here and write for myself without having to zone out halfway through. i was writing a tutorial a few weeks ago and i've scrapped it because i genuinely had no idea what i was doing. 13 yo me would be ashamed. it could be a combination of things, i don't have a very good diet, and i get tired easily. i try to eat healthy, or at the very least eat at home. surprisingly this pisses off my mom, i guess she just doesn't want to do dishes. hopefully when i move out, i'll be able to eat better. i really hate where i'm sitting right now, the same place as yesterday. there are obnoxious boys that are too close to me oh my god you have the whole hall why are you towering over me right now i'm about to scream. all of this because the library doesn't want to open. i hate it here. but apparently this school is top 100 of some best high school ranking. what a joke.

i spent last week pretty much doing nothing. i couldn't bring myself to do much of anything. i really just sat around on my bed. i couldn't even crochet, i only made a measly bookmark and a frogged multiple projects. i didn't go out with my friends, since they were either busy or out of town for thanksgiving. i did however learn how to make pancakes, so i ate those for 5/7 days of my break for breakfast. i also went to go clothes shopping with my parents, i bought a really pretty brown dress for my birthday, two pairs of jeans, and three tops. it was black friday deal, so it didn't end up being that costly (it was still expensive though eheheh).
    
when my birthday came around on, i spent it with my family. we had lunch at olive garden where the waiters sang to me because my parents wanted free cake. they pronounced my name wrong, but i'm not mad about it. when i was there, i saw these two really pretty girls. my mom's friend came to my house to give me pink roses and a gift card. after that i took some photos with the dress i had bought a day prior. i took them on my digital camera and my mom's phone. i posed with the flowers my mom's friend had bought me and they turned out really good. my and family then went out for dinner and came home at around 21:30. overall, it was a pretty good day. 

as i'm writing this, i'm sitting the same lunch spot i used to sit it as a freshman, in front of the gym door tucked away in a corner (a sign next to me almost fell on my as i was writing this!!!!!). the freshman boys next to me are disgusting and there is a very pretty woman in front of me. it is surprising how i still have the same reactions to the same situations, even from 4 years.
