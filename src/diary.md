this week has been nothing but a pain. i haven't been able to sleep, this is my third all nighter in a row. i'm not even doing anything productive, just scrolling like an asshole. my whole body has been hurting the entire week. on monday, i had the most debilitating back pain of my life in the morning, it was so bad i debated leaving early. it then spread to my abdomen and legs, where it has been lying since.

this weekend was probably one of my busiest weekends yet. 

on friday, me, H, A, and H's friends planned to go out trick or treating. i thought we were just going to watch a movie, but apparently i missed something, and we landed on H's friends tagging along. as such, i didn't have a costume, so i decided to do last minute spooky makeup instead. nonetheless, it was fun. we didn't get a lot of candy though, since we left pretty late. our group split up for the rest of the evening, and we went to H's place. one of her other friends were having a party, so we decided to stop there for a minute. i didn't know most of these people, so i mostly talked to A. however, i did meet a mutual friend of ours, W, so i talked to her as well. i tried to make an effort to introduce myself to the other people, but they were busy with each other. they were planning to go to super market, so i rode it our mutual friends car. we went to chipotle instead. i didn't get anything though, since i had eaten before leaving. i ended up coming home around 23:45. i took off my makeup and went to bed. 

i had a really good time, it was fun hanging out with my friends and meeting some new ones. however, it was really tiring, since i usually go to bed at around 21-22. i also had a lot of things to do the other day. 

on saturday morning, i went to my A's little sister's birthday to help out. i had worked the entire week making her a gift, this <a href="/crochet/" rel="internal">crochet cat</a>. it was right at 10, so i left shortly after waking up. in the mall, i came across a woman selling soap in a soap store, at first i was going to walk away, but the woman was really pretty, so i folded and followed her in. she showed me some luxury soaps (which i have no interest in...but whatever) and asked me questions about what kind of scents i like and what i avoid. i told her and she showed me some sample before directing me to the makeup. she sampled on some kind of foundation cream on me, and it blended in perfectly. it was the right shade and it didn't feel like i was wearing anything. i realized that i was spending too much time, so i took my leave. before i left, i told her i'd come back someday and she gave me a card with her name on it and the shade of the cream.

i went to where her birthday party was and gave the gift to her mother. her mom was surprised that i had come. H and A were both there, and H taught the both of us how to make balloon dogs. mine ended up a little messed up, so i had fun with it and made a "ballon hairless rat" and a balloon "mosquito-dog." i helped give out cake and pizza and juice boxes to the birthday girl's friends. we ate the left over pizza, and my friends ate the cake. i couldn't have the cake, so her mom gave me a little cup of ice cream. there were also temporary tattoos meant for the kids, but my friends and i ended up using them. we all got matching woodland creatures on our hands. 

later that afternoon, i went to go get a haircut. i ended up going to the wrong place at first, but i found my way before my appointment. i showed my hair dresser what i wanted, and she delivered! she gave me styling tips and a discontinued product that would be good for my hair. my friends had also planned dinner at 17:30, and the appointment ended at 17, so i left quickly. 

we had dinner at W's parents' place. it was a seafood restaurant. i had never had seafood before, so i was excited. i was initially going to carpool with my friends, but the haircut took too long so i drove myself. i ended up driving on a road i had never driven on before, reminiscent of a free-way. everyone was driving fast, and it was nerve racking. eventually i made it there and ordered the crab with my friend. i didn't order a whole dish for myself just in case i didn't like it, and i didn't know how long the portion sizes were. i tried it and it was delicious. i ordered snow crab with sausage and shrimp. my friend ended up eating most of it (i regret not ordering more), but it was still really good! i've wanted to try crab for years now, and now that i have, crab is my new favourite food now! i took a nibble of shrimp, but i think i'm allergic to it, so i took a benadryl pill and i was fine. after we finished eating, we went to a boba place down the block. i ordered a mango boba drink, and it was really yummy. i usually don't like boba, but the mango flavour of this one was super strong, so it was delicious. we all called it and evening and i drove back home. it was unfortunately dark and raining, so i could barely see what i was doing. my phone was also on low charge, so i was extremely anxious the entire way home. i also got home pretty late again, and went to bed. 

the next few days were a lot more relaxing, and i mostly stayed at home. i had a dmv appointment for renewing my license, but the lady said she couldn't do it. i ended up doing it online, so i'm really confused why she said i had to do it after i turned 18. i also needed to go to the dentist. at my appointment they said i would need to get my wisdom teeth removed. i'm not looking forward to that. i already had an oral surgery before, when i was really young, and it was awful. i will need to get it though, since i have no space in my mouth. 

my brother asked me to make him a a dragon, so that's my project for the week. i didn't crochet anything over the weekend, as i felt a little bit empty having finished the cat! there wasn't anything i could look forward to making, so hopefully this dragon changes that. i've yet to find a free pattern i like, so i might have to suck it up and buy one. i have my eyes on one right now, but i will keep scouring. most are annoyingly ai generated, so it has been tough finding real ones. 

college acceptances are slowly coming in, haven't received a rejection yet, but that will change soon.
