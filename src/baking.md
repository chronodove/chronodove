    "i really love this recipe! the muffins turned out really well, they are soft and not too chewy. this recipe called for applesauce, resulting in a slight hint of apple. it also uses syrup, but i honesly couldn't taste it. there's also no added sugar, so it isn't very sweet. the recipes also called for blueberries, but i didn't have them; next time i get them however, i will definitely put them in!"

    'a good recipe! i really like how soft and chewy these are. they are also really easy, but they took me a little longer since i am a beginner. i also under-baked them a little since i like softer cookies, so they look kind of pale. for my second batch, i cooked them for 13 min instead of 12, and they were slightly crunchy on the edges, but soft and chewy towards the center. though after a day or two, they became kind of tough; though this may be an error on my part.
