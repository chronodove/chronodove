## muffins

    "i thought this recipe would be the same as the one below, but to my surprise it wasn't! instead of using applesauce, this one uses milk. additionally, this uses a different method for baking, as it puts it in at a high temp in the beginning for a few minutes to make the tops rise, and then bake it normally. this recipe also says to add lemon in it but i....didn't.......want to.
    

    overall, the recipe was okay. the batter turned out super thick though, and i was concerned i did something wrong. but apparently thats how its supposed to be. when i was baking it, i followed the high temp. for the rest of recipe since i couldn't decrease the temp. on my oven, so thats why it looks the way it does LOL. i was worried it would be dry on the inside, but it was surprisingly soft! and honestly, i really like the crunchy exterior. though, i prefer the other recipe more, just because i really like apples lol. overall, pretty solid, but i'd probably not make this again unless i really wanted them."

## applesauce muffins

    "i really love this recipe! the muffins turned out really well, they are soft and not too chewy. this recipe called for applesauce, resulting in a slight hint of apple. it also uses syrup, but i honesly couldn't taste it. there's also no added sugar, so it isn't very sweet. the recipes also called for blueberries, but i didn't have them; next time i get them however, i will definitely put them in!"

## chocolate chip cookies

    'a good recipe! i really like how soft and chewy these are. they are also really easy, but they took me a little longer since i am a beginner. i also under-baked them a little since i like softer cookies, so they look kind of pale. for my second batch, i cooked them for 13 min instead of 12, and they were slightly crunchy on the edges, but soft and chewy towards the center. though after a day or two, they became kind of tough; though this may be an error on my part.
