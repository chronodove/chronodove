## chocolate chip cookies 
__<u>recipe:</u>__ [bakedabundance](https://bakedabundance.com/eggless-chocolate-chip-cookies/)

__<u>first made:</u>__ 10/26/25

__<u>thoughts:</u>__ a  good recipe! i really like how soft and chewy these are. they are also really easy, but they took me a little longer since i am a beginner. i also under-baked them a little since i like softer cookies, so they look kind of pale. for my second batch, i cooked them for 13 min instead of 12, and they were slightly crunchy on the edges, but soft and chewy towards the center.
