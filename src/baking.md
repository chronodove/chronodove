## chocolate chip cookies 2

    "my second attempt at cookies, this time without creaming butter and all in one bowl (YAY)! i really didn't feel like creaming butter, so i looked for one that used melted butter instead. overall, this is a pretty standard eggless recipe, except for the 2 whole sticks of butter. i feel like this much butter is overkill, but whatever, i'm not a baker. maybe because of the butter, or because i skipped adding in 1/2 cup of flour (i was scared that the dough would become too dry :((( ), the cookies are slightly buttery & a bit greasy like. interestingly enough, i had to bake these for 15-16 minutes rather than the recommended 9-11 minutes as they looked *way* too under-baked, in fact i think they still are 👎. other than that, these taste like how normal soft and chewy cookies taste, nothing mind-blowing. unlike my first attempt, these have continued to stay soft in storage, so i'm pleased with that. next time, i might add more chocolate chips, but overall, it's an easy and tasty recipe. **01/22 edit:** i made this again and made the cookies smaller (60g -> 45-6g) and baked it for 15 minutes and they turned out wonderful!! idk why the og recipe says to bake 60g cookies for 11 minutes thats genuinely insane."

## muffins

    "i thought this recipe would be the same as the one below, but to my surprise it wasn't! instead of using applesauce, this one uses milk. additionally, this uses a different method for baking, as it puts it in at a high temp in the beginning for a few minutes to make the tops rise, and then bake it normally. this recipe also says to add lemon in it but i....didn't.......want to.
    

    overall, the recipe was okay. the batter turned out super thick though, and i was concerned i did something wrong. but apparently thats how its supposed to be. when i was baking it, i followed the high temp. for the rest of recipe since i couldn't decrease the temp. on my oven, so thats why it looks the way it does LOL. i was worried it would be dry on the inside, but it was surprisingly soft! and honestly, i really like the crunchy exterior. though, i prefer the other recipe more, just because i really like apples lol. overall, pretty solid, but i'd probably not make this again unless i really wanted them."

## applesauce muffins

    "i really love this recipe! the muffins turned out really well, they are soft and not too chewy. this recipe called for applesauce, resulting in a slight hint of apple. it also uses syrup, but i honestly couldn't taste it. there's also no added sugar, so it isn't very sweet. the recipes also called for blueberries, but i didn't have them; next time i get them however, i will definitely put them in!"

    'a good recipe! i really like how soft and chewy these are. they are also really easy, but they took me a little longer since i am a beginner. i also under-baked them a little since i like softer cookies, so they look kind of pale. for my second batch, i cooked them for 13 min instead of 12, and they were slightly crunchy on the edges, but soft and chewy towards the center. though after a day or two, they became kind of tough; though this may be an error on my part.
