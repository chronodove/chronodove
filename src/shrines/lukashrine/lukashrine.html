                <h1>my history with luka</h1>
                <p>i'm going to out myself here, but i've actually had a really short history with luka.</p>
                <p>when i initially came across luka, i didn't pay too much attention to her. at the time (~13ish) i was really into more higher pitched voices, such as miku and rin. it wasn't until a few years later (~15) when i listen to a song with meiko i started to get more attracted to lower pitched voices. even then, i still neglected to pay attention to luka, and focused on meiko and kaito heavily. i hadn't really listen to any songs of hers besides luka luka night fever, but it wasn't until late last year i started to take her more seriously, specifically when i heard stardust utopia. after that, i started seeking out more of her and became obsessed!</p>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf5bTBEiSYA"><h3>stardust utopia - otetsu</h3></a>
                <p>one of the first songs other than luka luka night fever i had heard. this was the song that really solidified the fact that i love her ♥ i ADORE the way she sounds in this one, as well as the harmonies with a her higher pitched voice. the pv for this is also super cute as well. </p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgiZViaAY5w&list=RDMgiZViaAY5w&start_radio=1"><h3>double lariat - agoaniki</h3></a>
                <p>ALL TIME FAVORITE LUKA SONG. her tuning in this song is absolutely heavenly. she sounds so incredibly mature here and i love it. the choreography is also really well done and hypnotizing LOL. tako luka in the pv is just the cherry on top.</p>
