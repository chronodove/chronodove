went a field trip to a deserted restaurant in nevada or something with my old choir group. when we went inside, everyone's table had food except mine, so i had to leave. 

i had to trek back home by myself in sandals. when i got home, i had 4 birds, and one of them was bald. there were flying around my my friend H was there and when one flew into her she smacked it away. i told her not to do that, but she just turned her back to me ignored me.

i was at a large prairie which had a large oak tree right in the middle of it, somehow i had fallen and gotten stuck under a bridge that the tree was connected to, i called my mom but she wouldn't help me (this is a consistent thing in my dreams, the people i love most ignore me and are mean to me). i ended up having to try to survive and i think i almost got killed by a cheshire cat like woman. 
### woke up, fell back asleep.....
i made some sort of tik tok/reel about not going to big art stores like michaels and hobby lobby (in the video, their names were replaced with gibberish, but they were insults) and instead going to a local one. i then get teleported there. the store is cluttered and unorganized, there are balloons every where which makes it impossible to find anything. eventually i find what i was looking for, colored pencils, but they are unsharpened and unorganized and mixed with markers and crayons. a young man helps me sharpen and organize them with me. some people also walk in, including a complaining child. i then sit down on desk right next to pencils and work on a school assignment about classifying bugs. one of the bugs i need to classify is stuck to my bag, but i was too grossed out to touch it. i go back to the main school building where my school is having a pool party. the dress code was everyone wears a red sweater, but i didn't wear mine. i sat next to A for a bit she didn't talk to me for the first half hour. it wasn't until i changed into the red sweater she started to talk to me. orcas started flying/swimming in the sky and she asked me a question. i thought she was asking me about the orcas and what this event would be called, so i thought about it for a while and said "i think this would be called a 'tidal wave.'" she laughed and said "no thats dumb i wasn't talking about that, i was asking about what a nickname for a stupid person would be."

was in an odd hotel room that i'm pretty sure i've dreamt about before in a previous dream many years ago. i had a large crate full of thing from my childhood. i was for some reason sorting out toys, notebooks, sketchbooks, and paintings/drawings. i looked at my old drawings, and they were extremely well done. i think i was on a call with H, cause i kept saying, "H, i was such a good artist!" even though she wasn't there.
