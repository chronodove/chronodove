the dream started off with me and my parents and grandma in a forest of some sort. my grandma was posing next to a abnormally large baby dear. next, we went home and there was some kind of creature crawling all over our house. we were all very amused by it, and a lot of people would stand outside in our yard and look at it and take photos. everyone was smiling at it.

was watching a documentary of a chimpanzee slowly becoming depressed in tokyo. at the end, he ended up killing himself by jumping off of a apartment building which was in front of a park. the apartment was said to be haunted and would drive people insane. i somehow teleported myself inside the apartment and met a ginger man who was going in, but even before he entered he looked mortified. now i'm some little girl walking down outside the apartment and i see the chimp who actually didn't die. i also see a large white dog and an owner. i switch to the owners POV who let the girl pet the dog. the dog suddenly becomes aggressive and starts to maul the girl. the dream ends with the woman trying to pry the dog off the girl.

at first, my friend took me to a house which was a museum. inside there were many rooms, one of which was an antique display case with a lot of old spoons. behind the display, there was a middle age pale woman who led us to a balcony overlooking the living room. from the window, we were around a lake of some sort surrounded by many trees. through this balcony, there was also a horror maze/puzzle building. there were multiple floors and there were people in there that would chase you throughout the entire building if you couldn't solve a puzzle. i couldn't solve most of them, so i had multiple people chasing me. one had pushed me to the ground and cut my right knee. the cut had left a elliptical shaped scar with a small gap on the left side. i told my friend that i got cut but she didn't seem to care. then there was an abrupt times skip and i was back outside the building, but this time guiding people through the maze.
