i was at a car dealership of sorts and saw a made up japanese car that i really liked in the lot towards the back. it didn't have a gear shift and inside there were two happy buddha statues, one on the dash board and the other under the steering wheel on a shelf, somehow. i tried to get in but it was locked. i then drove (poorly) to some restaurant where three employees were fighting with each other, a very tall yet skinny man man versus two women. i want to say it was a starbucks because they were all wearing green aprons, but i don't recall any logos so i'm not sure. i some how got caught in the middle of fight and one of the employees pressed the back of his hand against my crotch. i was really uncomfortable and i started crying and ran away to the bathroom to hide. he followed me and peeked over the stall where he started antagonizing me and making fun of me. a blonde girl (who was in a previous dream of mine) who also worked there stopped him and took me away and offered to buy me some food. we went to another restaurant right next to that one called wendy's (not the fast food chain) and we got fries and ice cream and sat in my car. she comforted me as i ate, she held my hand and wiped my tears and told jokes and we laughed together. i think i ended up falling asleep in that dream too, as it suddenly flashed black and she was gone. i tried to drive back home but i got lost.
