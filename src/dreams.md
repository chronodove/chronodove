## 01/25/26
i was talking to an old classmate of mine in an cafeteria about making more friends and being more friendly in general. apparently that motivated me so much that i invited a couple of boys into my car. i left and when i came back my car was destroyed, the interior was ripped and they stole the container that held my gas and i think a wheel was gone. i was so distraught that i ran into a dormitory sobbing trying to find my room. as i was running through the halls i caught a glimpse of another classmate of mine. the names the doors weren't human names but random objects.

my room was infested with bugs and i was begging and crying to my dad to get rid of them but he didn't listen to me.
