    "because this was a last minute gift, i definitely took a lot of liberty with this pattern, especially for the limbs. i also didn't add safety eyes since the gift is for a four year old girl, and i don't want her getting hurt trying to tear out the eyes (they're surprisingly sharp!). the crocheting part was easy, but the sewing was hard. that's a just a fact about crocheting though, and this was my first real time doing it, so the pattern can't be blamed. the pattern was detailed and i could follow it easily. there are a lot of photos, and the author herself adds links to methods for sewing in the pattern. a big plus. even with the sewing, i had a good time making this. next time, if i have time, i definitely want to honor the long limbs the original pattern includes."
