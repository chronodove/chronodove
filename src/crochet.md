    "a little more practice with a [single crochet foundation chain](https://mycrochetory.com/how-to-foundation-single-crochet-fsc/) and the [alternate stitch](https://richtexturescrochet.com/alternate-stitch-how-to-crochet/). i think its kinda cute, it's also like a portable bookmark lol."

    "i noticed that i was in need for more facial clothes—since right now i only have one—and when thats in the wash, i have to use a normal one to dry my face which makes me feel gross lol. i already has a desire to make an actual \"functional\" crochet piece and to try out new stitches, so naturally i decided to make a piece of cloth. this was my first time using cotton yarn, and i was surprised by how slippery it is to work with! i also wanted to try out a new type of stitch, the [lemon peel](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/lemon-peel-stitch-4775709) one. i think it turned out really good, but it is quite small. i'm currently remaking it but in a larger size."

## daisy bookmark

    "i also finished this in one day, less than two hours! the pattern looks intimidating, but it was incredibly easy. my bookmark has a severe curl due to the chains and maybe my tension, so i'll need to block it. though i'm curious what it would look like if i used a foundation chain rather than chains to make it more flexible! i didn't add the tassel because i'm lazy. overall, i really like this pattern and i'll definitely be making these as gifts for my friends! **12/07/25 edit:** i tried  blocking it but i don't think it worked :((("

## bear glasses holder

    "i finished this in one day! it wasn't hard to follow, but i'm pretty sure i messed up somewhere along the way. the most difficult part was getting used to using 2 skeins of yarn at the same time and managing how thick the yarn was. i ended up going from a 4.5 to 6mm hook; i usually stick to 3-4mm hooks, so this was a learning experience for sure. overall, not a bad pattern."

## small cat for my friend's younger sister's birthday

    "because this was a last minute gift, i definitely took a lot of liberty with this pattern, especially for the limbs. i also didn't add safety eyes since the gift is for a four year old girl, and i don't want her getting hurt trying to tear out the eyes (they're surprisingly sharp!). the crocheting part was easy, but the sewing was hard. that's a just a fact about crocheting though, and this was my first real time doing it, so the pattern can't be blamed. the pattern was detailed and i could follow it easily. there are a lot of photos, and the author herself adds links to methods for sewing in the pattern. a big plus. even with the sewing, i had a good time making this. next time, if i have time, i definitely want to honor the long limbs the original pattern includes."
