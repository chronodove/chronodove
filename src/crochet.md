    "i actually hate this piece LOL. i was so mad and grumpy when i was working on it and i have no idea why. i think thats the reason it looks the way it does and why it took so long. idk why this turned out so horrible. yeah, not much to say. i simply don't like it. i'm going to try to remake this one day, hopefully i'll be in a less pissy mood."

    "my first tapestry crochet!! i think it turned out really good. funny enough, this is supposed to be a filet crochet piece, but i didn't feel confident enough so i turned it into a tapestry crochet one. i originally wanted to make a large tapestry piece a few months ago, but i got intimidated. i think i should've started with this one instead. tapestry is definitely a \"trust the process\" kind of thing. the only thing that i had problems with was yarn tangling, but everyone struggles with that LOL."

    "first project of february! tried to make a cute small pouch and i think it turned out okay. i think i will have to remake this, as it looks really slanted to me. i think it's because the flap was crocheted at the same time as the body. but i'm not a hundred percent sure that this is the reason. it could also be because its unblocked. but whatever, it still does its job of holding things!"

    "this square is MASSIVE. i didn't expect it to be so big, even though i should have. other than that, this was actually quite easy. i first found this pattern when i was just starting to crochet, but i didn't have the confidence back then. i got bored and i decided to scroll through my saved ravelry patterns and found this and tried it. it worked up quickly, and i had fun making it!"

    "my first paid pattern!...that i've completed at least. i was looking at pouches to make and i found a tutorial on how to make a cute one out of a granny square using this pattern. i completely feel in love with the way that it looked, so much so that i just had to buy it! this actually took quite some time to start and i think its because i was anxious. i kept restarting after the first few rounds, but i eventually got the hang of it.  nonetheless, this was one of the more fun projects that i've worked on. it really challenged me and it actually felt rewarding when i finished it. i'm definitely going to try to make another one with different colors like the original one i saw."

    "this was actually my second attempt at making this pouch, and i'm genuinely so surprised at how different the two are. i know that they use diff yarns and hooks, but even looking at the stitching its obvious. my original one is so clumsy and inconsistent in stitches, i can't believe i was happy with it...lol. other than that, theres nothing else notable about this piece."

    "i also finished this in one day, less than two hours! the pattern looks intimidating, but it was incredibly easy. my bookmark has a severe curl due to the chains and maybe my tension, so i'll need to block it. though i'm curious what it would look like if i used a foundation chain rather than chains to make it more flexible! i didn't add the tassel because i'm lazy. overall, i really like this pattern and i'll definitely be making these as gifts for my friends! **12/07/25 edit:** i tried  blocking it but i don't think it worked :((("

    "i finished this in one day! it wasn't hard to follow, but i'm pretty sure i messed up somewhere along the way. the most difficult part was getting used to using 2 skeins of yarn at the same time and managing how thick the yarn was. i ended up going from a 4.5 to 6mm hook; i usually stick to 3-4mm hooks, so this was a learning experience for sure. overall, not a bad pattern."

## small cat for my friend's younger sister's birthday

    "because this was a last minute gift, i definitely took a lot of liberty with this pattern, especially for the limbs. i also didn't add safety eyes since the gift is for a four year old girl, and i don't want her getting hurt trying to tear out the eyes (they're surprisingly sharp!). the crocheting part was easy, but the sewing was hard. that's a just a fact about crocheting though, and this was my first real time doing it, so the pattern can't be blamed. the pattern was detailed and i could follow it easily. there are a lot of photos, and the author herself adds links to methods for sewing in the pattern. a big plus. even with the sewing, i had a good time making this. next time, if i have time, i definitely want to honor the long limbs the original pattern includes."
