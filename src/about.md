# about chronodove
hello, my name is dove. i am a high school senior. i am interested in engineering, marine life, and birds. my birthday is 11/28 or 28/11. i'm from the northern part of the us but moved to the southern part 4 years ago. i plan to move back north for college. i speak english and hindi. i have 2 budgies named **aam** and **kittu**.

outside of school and when i have energy, i like to code, read, sew, and crochet. i am not good at any of these, but i still find myself enjoying the time i spend with these crafts.

i like math more than english. i despise chemistry. 

my favorite perfumes are *hugo boss ma vie*, *victoria's secret velvet petals*, and *mix bar cloud musk n21*. my favorite animals are birds and fishes. i hate anything chewy. my favorite colors are dark reds, dark browns, dark blues, whites/creams, and black. i'm okay with spicy food. my favorite fruit is orange and my favorite vegetable is spinach. i listen to all kinds of music, but my playlist is mostly alternative/indie rock. 

i am a big fan of minimalism and simplicity, but i appreciate maximalism.
