###### i am not a fragrance snob so i won't be going into detail for a lot of these....srry. also all the images & prices are from amazon, though you can find most perfumes cheaper by getting their travel sizes or going on ebay or [jomashop](https://jomashop.com/)

## pear inc.
{{entry.field (

    "pear inc. (0.25 oz)",
    "juliette has a gun",
    "34.00",
    "main notes: PEAR
    
    literally lasts forever. so overwhelmingly pear (positively). musky. kind of unisex, but is a too little sweet to be considered that fully.",
    "5",
    "my favorite perfume of the year even though at the time of writing this it is only january. this literally lasts forever. i love it. it is super sophisticated and has so much pear, which i absolutely adore."

    "main notes: wild berry, orange, vanilla 
    
    its quite sweet. as it sat, it became super strong and started to hurt my head. not long lasting", 
    "2", 
    "i used to really like this back in middle school haha, but i think i've out grown it; it's quite teenager like. i do not remember it being so strong though!!! i think i would have given this a higher rating it IT DIDN'T GIVE ME A HEADACHE."
