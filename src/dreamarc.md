i was talking to an old classmate of mine in an cafeteria about making more friends and being more friendly in general. apparently that motivated me so much that i invited a couple of boys into my car. i left and when i came back my car was destroyed, the interior was ripped and they stole the container that held my gas and i think a wheel was gone. i was so distraught that i ran into a dormitory sobbing trying to find my room. as i was running through the halls i caught a glimpse of another classmate of mine. the names the doors weren't human names but random objects.

my room was infested with bugs and i was begging and crying to my dad to get rid of them but he didn't listen to me.

### 12/14/25
went a field trip to a deserted restaurant in nevada or something with my old choir group. when we went inside, everyone's table had food except mine, so i had to leave. 

i had to trek back home by myself in sandals. when i got home, i had 4 birds, and one of them was bald. there were flying around my my friend H was there and when one flew into her she smacked it away. i told her not to do that, but she just turned her back to me and ignored me.

### 12/08/25
i was at a large prairie which had a large oak tree right in the middle of it, somehow i had fallen and gotten stuck under a bridge that the tree was connected to, i called my mom but she wouldn't help me (this is a consistent thing in my dreams, the people i love most ignore me and are mean to me). i ended up having to try to survive and i think i almost got killed by a cheshire cat like woman. 
### woke up, fell back asleep.....
i made some sort of tik tok/reel about not going to big art stores like michaels and hobby lobby (in the video, their names were replaced with gibberish, but they were insults) and instead going to a local one. i then get teleported there. the store is cluttered and unorganized, there are balloons every where which makes it impossible to find anything. eventually i find what i was looking for, colored pencils, but they are unsharpened and unorganized and mixed with markers and crayons. a young man helps me sharpen and organize them with me. some people also walk in, including a complaining child. i then sit down on desk right next to pencils and work on a school assignment about classifying bugs. one of the bugs i need to classify is stuck to my bag, but i was too grossed out to touch it. i go back to the main school building where my school is having a pool party. the dress code was everyone wears a red sweater, but i didn't wear mine. i sat next to A for a bit she didn't talk to me for the first half hour. it wasn't until i changed into the red sweater she started to talk to me. orcas started flying/swimming in the sky and she asked me a question. i thought she was asking me about the orcas and what this event would be called, so i thought about it for a while and said "i think this would be called a 'tidal wave.'" she laughed and said "no thats dumb i wasn't talking about that, i was asking about what a nickname for a stupid person would be."  

### 12/07/25
was in an odd hotel room that i'm pretty sure i've dreamt about before in a previous dream many years ago. i had a large crate full of thing from my childhood. i was for some reason sorting out toys, notebooks, sketchbooks, and paintings/drawings. i looked at my old drawings, and they were extremely well done. i think i was on a call with H, cause i kept saying, "H, i was such a good artist!" even though she wasn't there.

### 12/04/25
i lost my bottom left canine tooth and i was really freaking out about it.

#### (multiple naps)
went to some kind of boba/tattoo shop

running back and forth in the lawn of my parents old home while some black creature watched me from the deck

explored a website/blog with a pale yellow color scheme

was dating a girl whose name started with an m (may? maya?) with dark hair and eyes. she was obsessed with me 

### 11/05/25
started off with me watching(? or being?) a dutch girl. i was dancing on the roof top before realizing i have no way to get down. then i woke up in another dream. i was driving my family to some restaurant, and my mom kept making fun of me. i got tired of it and ran away, hearing her taunt me until i left. as i started walking to the car, my dad stopped me and told me he would take me to the festival nearby. i accepted and he drove me there. it wasn't even a two minute drive before we got there. it was reminiscent of old english buildings and alleyways. it had a lot of shop and people. i stopped by one yarn store called hobbii and looked to see some yarn. there wasn't any on the stall racks, so my dad went behind the cashier and tried finding it while holding a scanner. the cashier told my dad to leave and tried getting back the scanner, but he wouldn't let him. 

i then was transported to an aquaintence house, where a few boys were staying. i don't remember much, but i do remember when i was trying to take a bath, their clothes were everywhere and had strange white fur on it. apparently i was wearing a winter coat, and as i was taking it off, the white fur kept sticking to it.

was in a lazy river in the white void. there were ducks and people were trying to catch them. then a huge wave came and before i was to get crushed i woke up. 

### 10/25/25
the dream started off with me and my parents and grandma in a forest of some sort. my grandma was posing next to a abnormally large baby dear. next, we went home and there was some kind of creature crawling all over our house. we were all very amused by it, and a lot of people would stand outside in our yard and look at it and take photos. everyone was smiling at it.

### 10/10/25
talked to some ai counselor about college. it told me that my rank had dropped and my scores were invalid. my gpa was a 4.2 and my sat was a 800 and my act was 17. 

### 10/03/25
was watching a documentary of a chimpanzee slowly becoming depressed in tokyo. at the end, he ended up killing himself by jumping off of a apartment building which was in front of a park. the apartment was said to be haunted and would drive people insane. i somehow teleported myself inside the apartment and met a ginger man who was going in, but even before he entered he looked mortified. now i'm some little girl walking down outside the apartment and i see the chimp who actually didn't die. i also see a large white dog and an owner. i switch to the owners POV who let the girl pet the dog. the dog suddenly becomes aggressive and starts to maul the girl. the dream ends with the woman trying to pry the dog off the girl.

at first, my friend took me to a house which was a museum. inside there were many rooms, one of which was an antique display case with a lot of old spoons. behind the display, there was a middle age pale woman who led us to a balcony overlooking the living room. from the window, we were around a lake of some sort surrounded by many trees. through this balcony, there was also a horror maze/puzzle building. there were multiple floors and there were people in there that would chase you throughout the entire building if you couldn't solve a puzzle. i couldn't solve most of them, so i had multiple people chasing me. one had pushed me to the ground and cut my right knee. the cut had left a elliptical shaped scar with a small gap on the left side. i told my friend that i got cut but she didn't seem to care. then there was an abrupt times skip and i was back outside the building, but this time guiding people through the maze.
