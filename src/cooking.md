    "my first time frying and breading something, it was both rewarding and very difficult. removing the onion membrane was super tedious, and my onion had like two parts in it? so it didn't form many rings like i wanted but, but regardless, the remaining wings and crescent shapes turned out well. it was also very hard to fully coat the rings, i tried using to avoid touching them using tongs--because i hate touching wet foods--but it made my struggles worse. eventually i gave up and started to use my hands. i had to wipe them off every time though, so i made my mom do them lol. as she battered, i started frying. the first two didn't turn out crunchy due to the oil being to hot and only cooking the outside, but the rest turned out well! i then was feeling kind of over heated, so i stopped frying and made a mock cane's sauce. the sauce is def a must, as the rings are admittedly a plain by themselves, but thats by design ;). either way, really yummy, but had to knock it down a point.

    "i completely winged this recipe, everything was measured by heart! but my god did this turn out delicious! believe it or not, this was my first time actually trying parmesan and i've completely fallen in love with it. it was super creamy and filling. i didn't expect something so simple to taste this good. i'll definitely have this on my lazy dinner rotation.
