           <h2>5/27 - 21:18</h2>
           <p>tomorrow is my first day at a community college.</p>
           <p>my high school offers a dual credit program at a local community college for free, it allows high school students to complete some of their credits needed early. although i'm just going so i can skip some of my classes like u.s history.</p>
           <p>it;s pretty nerveracking, but i'm surprised i'm not as anxious as i thought i would be. i'm actually more excited!</p>
           <p>this is definetly going to be good for me, geting used to how college assignments work and all. i'll need this since i'll be taking 6 AP's next year...</p>
           <p>this will also mean more updates to this site(by site i mean this journal/diary)!! yay!!</p>
