<h1 id="me">ME</h1>
    <p>hi im dove. im a teenager just typing on my computer. i don't have many interesting traits.</p>
    <p>i use she/her pronouns and i'm unlabeled as of now, i'll probably write a little rant about it eventually.</p>
    <p>i prefer to keep to myself, my timidness extends from my flesh to my wires. but asides that, i like to think i'm a focused individual who likes to live in her head.</p>
    <p>im indian and i speak both english and hindi. my ethnicity is a very important part of me, it defines a lot of my views on the world and myself.</p>
    <p>if i were to describe myself as an animal, i would be a jumping spider. a small & curious creature.</p>
    <h1 id="hobbies">HOBBIES</h1>
    <p>i don't actually have a lot of hobbies, but my main ones would be coding. reading/studying & daydreaming.</p>
    <p>some that i'll do once in a while would be drawing, playing videogames, and watching tv.</p>
    <h1 id="fav">LOVES</h1>
    <p>i don't use the word "<i>love</i>" lightly, it's such a heavy and serious word to me.</p>
    <p>but i consider these things the love of my life, the light of my life.</p>
    <p>my friends, my family, arachnids, rodents, reptiles, sea animals, math, science, computers, and music.</p>
    <p>and also the ":3" emoticon. hes so goofy i love him</p>
    <p>i could go into the specifics... but that would take too long. maybe someday i'll list them all out properly.</p>
    <h1 id="history">HISTORY</h1>
    <p>i started this site completely new to web development and coding as a whole. i don't actually remember how i came across neocities, but i remember making an account long ago and forgetting about it until september of 2023.</p>
    <p>back then, i used a template i had found while digging through the web, and i had absolutely no idea what i was doing. it was so bad.</p>
    <p>eventually i had started to make my own layouts and searching up tutorials for things i wanted to do, and here we are!</p>
    <p>developing this website is one of the few constants in my life at this point, it's almost a organism thats detached from me. it shares some of my genes but it's it own being.</p>
    <h1 id="finalwords">FIN</h1>
    <p>thank you for reading this far about me. as a token on my gratitude, here's one of my favorite poems as of now.</p> 
    <p><i>Nocturne</i> by Louis L'Amour.</p>
    <i><p>"The stars unveil</p>
    <p>As clouds regale</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Themselves with flight,</p>
    <p>The moon, a moth</p>
    <p>Whom loves betroth</p>
      <p>&nbsp;To summer night.</p>
    <p>The trees a fringe</p>
    <p>That darkly cringe</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Along the sky;</p>
    <p>And I, alone, </p>
    <p>Regret I've known</p>
      <p>&nbsp;That love can die.</p>
    <p>The hours sound deep,</p>
    <p>I cannot sleep</p>
      <p>&nbsp;For love is gone;</p>
    <p>No stars remain</p>
    <p>To mourn my playing </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Or greet the dawn."</p>

                <p>my teacher allowed me to redo my missed lesson at home, so i wont have to come back in during my spring break!!</p>
                <p>really excited to go back to having free time after school LOL</p>

                <h1>2-24-24</h1>
                <p>i have a really funny story.</p>
                <p>so i just recently decided to actually commit to linux. because believe it or not, i've had the linux mint iso file for like a YEAR.</p> 
                <p>i kept procrastionating and forgetting about it UNTIL NOW!!!!</p>
                <p>so i boot up the preview and i enjoy mint! so i decide to click install and go through the process except...</p>
                <p>I CORRUPTED THE INSTALL AND ENDED REMOVING BOTH MINT <b>AND</b> WINDOWS.</p>
                <p>naturally im freaking out, how am i supposed to recover now?? i have no os or anything (thinking about it now i could have downloaded another iso from my school laptop but i was panicing) what could i ever do!</p>
                <p>i look into my drawer and then i see it...</p>
                <h3>the ubuntu flash drive</h3>
                <p>i completely forgot i had this with me! i have nothing to lose so might as well.</p>
                <p>i boot it up and my entire screen is just messed up. everything it so yellow i can barely read it!</p>
                <p>thankfully, i wasn't the only one who expierenced this, i just needed to fix the colour settings through the display settings. though it took a while considering i literally could not see the text.</p>
                <p>i wasn't enjoying the ubuntu so i re-flashed the usb with linux mint and set it up PROPERLY this time.</p>
                <p>and now i'm a linux user! mint is very similar to windows in the way it looks but BETTER!!!! </p>
                <p>its so much more customizable and so much more flexible, it's just better!</p>
                <p>it definitely going to be harder to install programs, but in wine (the emulator) we trust.</p>
                <p>this all happened at like 7 in morning too, so that quite the start.</p>

                <h1>2-19-24</h1>
                <p>tomorrow i go back to school, finally.</p>
                <p>i hate sitting at home doing nothing, it's so incredibly boring.</p>
                <p>if i dont have a routine, i'm a mess in more ways than one.</p>
                <p>i went to drivers ed, my class was short because my teacher was sick. i hope she feels better.</p>
                <p>i filled out my forms for summer internships, but got confused at one part and sent an email to my counselor. they need to make these things better.</p>
                <p>i also painted my nails black because i'm just so bored, i think they look nice. i'd love to be more edgy/gothic but my parents like to say "oh we're chill!!!" until they see me in black eyeshadow. </p>
                <p>i can't wait to go back to school and work. i love working. it keeps my mind busy so i don't start having a crisis.</p>
                <p>i've been thinking about finding a therapist but where i live it's pretty difficult to find one, it wasn't back in minnesota.</p>
                <p>i miss minnesota. i want to go back there for college. it's much better than this redneck state.</p>
                <p>other than that i've been playing subnautica, it's been so fun! i really enjoy this game. i haven't had that much fun playing video games in a while.</p>
                <p>here are tomorrows goals.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>finalize my applications</li>
                </ol>
                <p>thats all i really need to do. i can't wait for tomorrow.</p>

                    <h1>2-17-24</h1>
                    <p>first diary entry. yippie!</p>
                    <p>i drove for the first time today with my dad. i just got my permit after almost 5 months of trying to get one. i understand why people say the DMV is hell on earth.</p>
                    <p>i practiced doing turns in the parking lot, there was also a motorcycle class going on in the parking lot adjacent to mine.</p>
                    <p>i'm definitely going to learn how to drive a motorcycle once i'm done with drivers ed. i love seeing bikers on the street. i always wave at them but some don't wave back.</p>
                    <p>back when i was in mn, i rarely ever saw motorcycles parked, let alone people riding them. it makes sense though, minnesota is very cold and icy. motorcycle and ice is not a good combination.</p>
                    <p>i am horrible at driving. but i'll be able to get more practice tomorrow and monday.</p>
                    <p>but my drivers ed is absolutely tearing me apart. everyday i come home just exhausted. it's right after my school ends, which is 4pm. then i only get about 45 minutes to rest at home before class starts at 5pm all the way until 7pm.</p>
                    <p>i also wake up at 5:30am by the way. i have to be awake for 13 hours 4 days a week.</p>
                    <p>it doesn't sound like a lot, but on top of that i have homework, friends, family, eating, cleaning, and so much more. also, it's tiring! being awake for 13 hours straight is not something i'm used too!</p>
                    <p>thank god it's only until the end of feb, if i had to do this for any longer i might actually jump off my roof (metaphorically).</p>
                    <p>i played a little bit of elden ring today too, but again i suck at it. i keep dying to the same guy over and over. it's my first dark souls game too, i probably should have chosen an easier one maybe...</p>
                    <p>i've also been looking into internships over the summer. and by some luck my school had some opportunities available for students. hopefully they'll accept me.</p>
                    <p>thats all i was able to do today, but i have some goals for tomorrow.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>actually finish applying for those internships</li>
                        <li>clean up my room</li>
                        <li>do some sat prep so my dad can get off my back (i'm not even taking it this year)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>thats all for today, thank you for reading about my super mundane life. i really appreciate it :)</p>
