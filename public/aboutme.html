    <h1 id="me">ME</h1>
    <p>hi im dove. im a teenager just typing on my computer. i don't have many interesting traits.</p>
    <p>i use she/her pronouns and i'm unlabeled as of now, i'll probably write a little rant about it eventually.</p>
    <p>i prefer to keep to myself, my timidness extends from my flesh to my wires. but asides that, i like to think i'm a focused individual who likes to live in her head.</p>
    <p>im indian and i speak both english and hindi. my ethnicity is a very important part of me, it defines a lot of my views on the world and myself.</p>
    <p>if i were to describe myself as an animal, i would be a jumping spider. a small & curious creature.</p>
    <h1 id="hobbies">HOBBIES</h1>
    <p>i don't actually have a lot of hobbies, but my main ones would be coding. reading/studying & daydreaming.</p>
    <p>some that i'll do once in a while would be drawing, playing videogames, and watching tv.</p>
    <h1 id="fav">LOVES</h1>
    <p>i don't use the word "<i>love</i>" lightly, it's such a heavy and serious word to me.</p>
    <p>but i consider these things the love of my life, the light of my life.</p>
    <p>my friends, my family, arachnids, rodents, reptiles, sea animals, math, science, computers, and music.</p>
    <p>and also the ":3" emoticon. hes so goofy i love him</p>
    <p>i could go into the specifics... but that would take too long. maybe someday i'll list them all out properly.</p>
    <h1 id="history">HISTORY</h1>
    <p>i started this site completely new to web development and coding as a whole. i don't actually remember how i came across neocities, but i remember making an account long ago and forgetting about it until september of 2023.</p>
    <p>back then, i used a template i had found while digging through the web, and i had absolutely no idea what i was doing. it was so bad.</p>
    <p>eventually i had started to make my own layouts and searching up tutorials for things i wanted to do, and here we are!</p>
    <p>developing this website is one of the few constants in my life at this point, it's almost a organism thats detached from me. it shares some of my genes but it's it own being.</p>
    <h1 id="finalwords">FIN</h1>
    <p>thank you for reading this far about me. as a token on my gratitude, here's one of my favorite poems as of now.</p> 
    <p><i>Nocturne</i> by Louis L'Amour.</p>
    <i><p>"The stars unveil</p>
    <p>As clouds regale</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Themselves with flight,</p>
    <p>The moon, a moth</p>
    <p>Whom loves betroth</p>
      <p>&nbsp;To summer night.</p>
    <p>The trees a fringe</p>
    <p>That darkly cringe</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Along the sky;</p>
    <p>And I, alone, </p>
    <p>Regret I've known</p>
      <p>&nbsp;That love can die.</p>
    <p>The hours sound deep,</p>
    <p>I cannot sleep</p>
      <p>&nbsp;For love is gone;</p>
    <p>No stars remain</p>
    <p>To mourn my playing </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Or greet the dawn."</p>
