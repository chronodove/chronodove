<body>
    <p>i really don't think im a human. physically, yes. i am a human. but mentally i see myself <br>as a dog.</p>
    <p>now i am well aware that i am not a dog. i am a human.</p>
    <p>i don't think i have a "gender" either. i am fine with she/her pronouns, <br>but calling myself a <em>woman</em> makes me very uncomfortable.</p>
