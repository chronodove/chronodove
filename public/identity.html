   <p>i consider myself a dog more than a human.</p>
   <p>my behavior aligns more closely to them, obidient, loyal, relible and right by your side.</p>
   <p>i don't like calling myself a person, i know i am but i avoid refering to myself that in real life as much as i can.</p>
   <p>theres a lot wrong with me but this is the least concerning one LMFAO</p>
