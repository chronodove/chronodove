                    <p>this book holds a lot of sentimental value to me. it was the first book i picked up at my local bookstore. it had no cover, just the words "BREATHE FIRE" written on its spine. i felt drawn to it.</p>
                    <p>this book was my real first friend, the only thing i knew when i first moved. i felt so alone during that time, but this book helped me.</p>
                    <p>because of that, i put this book in high regard.</p>
                    <p>sky in the deep is an adventurous viking-esque story about a young woman named Eelyn and her quest to find her brother and unite two clans who --violently-- hate each other.</p>
                    <p>looking at from the eyes of a mentally well-adjusted reader, the book is okay. it's a good read for some action, but it doesn't really leave an impact. you read it and you're done.</p>
                    <p>it's been almost four (woah!) years since i last read this book, so this is a very lackluster review.</p>

                    <h6>read: 09/18/24</h6>
                    <p>she and her cat is a collection of short stories all connected by a cat named chobi. the stories weave within one another resulting in a heartwarming tale.</p>
                    <p>i LOVE this book. such a cute and comforting read. i wa able to finish it in almost one sitting, only stopped because class was over! it's quite short, but such a lovely experience.</p>
                    <p>because of how short it was, i really don't have a lot to say. it's actually my only complaint, i would have loved for it to be longer.</p>
