                    <h3>crispy potato balls</h3>
                    <h6>modified from: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wHI6Xs-oGs">ALOi's</a> recipe</h6>
                    <h6>make time: <= 15 minutes</h6>
                    <br>
                    <h3>ingredients:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>1-2 russet potatos (adjust for serving size & for potato size)</li>
                        <li>~1/2-1 tbsp of cornstarch </li>
                        <li>1/2 tsp of salt and chili powder (recommended amount) </li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <h3>steps:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>peel potatoes and cut into fairly large chunks.</li>
                        <li>heat up water to a boil and place potato chunks in for about 5-7 minutes. to check if they are done, insert a fork in a chunk; if the fork goes all the way through without much force, they are finished.</li>
                        <li>drain the boiled potatoes and mash.</li>
                        <li>add 1/2-1 tbsp of cornstarch and add some salt and chili powder to taste. if the potatoes are sticky, add small amounts of cornstarch until the texture is almost dryish. if they are too dry, add a small amount of oil to rebind the potatoes and cornstarch together.</li>
                        <li>form the potatoes into balls of any size or any shape to your liking.</li>
                        <li>place the potatoes in hot oil and fry at medium heat until golden.</li>
                        <li>serve with ketchup and enjoy.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>tips:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>be generous with cornstarch, as if you don't add enough, the balls will melt when frying.</li>
                        <li>also, be generous with the seasonings. i've made this twice and both times i didn't add enough chili powder to be able to taste it.</li>
