          <p><b>03:48;</b> today, i present my final mvp pitch. i've already given up. yesterday was my seminar presentation. everything that could have gone wrong went wrong. i think i had a panic attack right in the middle of it. all i could do is stare at the judges & just keep reading of my note-cards. we were being filmed which made it ten times worse. i just broke down right in front of them, pathetically saying nothing in-between voice cracks.</p>
          <p>i've been re-watching rick & morty, i've never related more to jerry. whenever rick criticizes jerry, it's like i'm getting called out. i've also been watching baki hanma. it's okay so far, i was not expecting to see <span class="spoiler">the former american president george h. w. bush get kidnapped by a japanese teenager</span>, however.</p>
          <p><b>07:41;</b> february always tends to be my busiest month. last year i had drivers ed everyday afterschool, & now i have clubs & presentations & volunteering. how annoying.</p>
          <p><b>10:29;</b> the presentation went wonderfully !! everyone was amazing & my dearest friend S was there. we got good ideas & good feedback, i am so glad !</p>
          <p><b>11:27;</b> enjoying the quiet, i don't have anything else to stress about this entire week. very grateful. i hope the rest of this week stays like this. i'm aso going to buy a book i've been eying, <i>what you are looking for is in the library.</i> it's seems similar to <i>days at the morisaki bookshop</i>, & i deeply enjoyed that book. i want to see if i can get a paper copy, but a digital one will also suffice. i think i'll re-read <i>smoke by the altar</i> by louis l'amour. i love his poems. asides from that, i've been watching hell's kitchen too, just in the background while i'm doing something else. it's good background noise, despite how vulgar it can get sometimes. i channel my rage through ramsay's, he says everything i would love to say in person.</p>
          <p>liking my short hair. now when i wash it, it takes around an hour & a half to dry, as opposed to the previous three hours. a welcome change. i don't like to a lot on my hair, since it & the rest of me are sensitive other products. i tried this conditioner one time & when i washed it off, so much of my hair came out. it's still sitting in my bathroom pantry. i don't know what to do with it, it's been over a year. how wasteful. my current shampoo & conditioner are very expensive. it's olaplex, around $35 for a bottle of each. when i went to my hairdresser, she gave me a recommendation for <i>shibui</i>, a little less pricey (around $20). once i run out of my current stock, i'll see if i can try it out.</p>
          <p>i ended up sleeping early last night out of the pure distress i felt from the previous day. i woke up at 21:00, fell back asleep, & since 01:00 i've been up. hopefully near the place i'll be volunteering at, i'll be able to get a coffee.</p>
          <p>when i had went out with my friend on the first, i bought new pens & today i got to try them out. they are 1.0 thickness & i absolutely adore writing with them. they are by sharpie, the only caveat i have with them is that the ink is very dark. but it is made by sharpie, so thats to be expected sort of. either way, its a joy to write with them. they are very smooth & i feel like i have a lot more control with them than the thinner sizes. i've been looking into getting a fountain pen for my own pleasure, i've saved some cheap ones on amazon. in the summer i'll get a job, so hopefully i'll be able to buy a nice expensive one. </p>
          <p><b>13:51;</b> overheard someone talking shit about my presentation in class while making eye contact with me. incredible how little it takes to ruin my mood & self confidence.</p>
          <p><b>19:42;</b> came back from errands & volunteering. only stayed for around half an hour because my allergies got triggered somehow. i think it was because the clothes had some pet hairs on it, it makes me sneeze. very tired, will get some rest.</p>

          <p><b>13:30;</b> wish i wasnt such a piece of shit. oh well.</p>
          <p><b>14:06;</b> i should have dropped out of seminar. why cant i stop making mistakes. youd think id learn from them by now but NOOOPAAAAAAAA !!!! </p>

          <p><b>03:06;</b> happy february. i didn't post the final entry for jan, but it's fine. my gripes about that month should be left behind. however if you are curious, <a href="https://rentry.co/dxctzf6d">heres the link.</a> i haven't cleaned it up, per se, but i'll get around to it eventually.</p>
          <p><b>18:41;</b> hung out with my best & sweetest friend. we went to target & got starbucks. i bought a new sketchbook, pens, & lotion. shes such a good & genuine person. i keep saying it, but it's true. compared to her, i'm nothing like her. she's the lamb & i'm the wolf.</p>
          <p>i find myself venting to her a lot, & she always listens. she doesn't vent to me, but i want her to. i feel guilty, she isn't my therapist. she's very emotionally mature & smart, something i'm not. she really doesn't deserve a friend like me, but she seems genuinely happy to see me. maybe she does like me.</p>
          <p>today was a good start to february. i hope it continues.</p>
