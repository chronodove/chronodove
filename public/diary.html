          <p>i cut my hair. it's shorter than i wanted it to be but i love it. its side swept this time, different from the usual middle part i usually get.i wanted it to cut it to the middle of my chest, but it almost reaches my shoulders. my hair grows fast though, i'm not too worried.</p>
          <p>got through the presentation. was a trainwreck. i also sucked. other people were good.</p>
          <p>18:00; i felt such a rush of rage during physics, seeing <b>her</b>. she hasn't even done anything to me, and yet, i can't stop myself from cursing her out in my mind. she younger than me, and more mature than me. i'm jealous of a little girl.</p>

          <p>slept as soon as i had gotten home yesterday. still slept well in the night though.</p>
          <p>13:35; sent out a new survey for my project. my mom didn't send it to people and neither did my teammates. fml.</p>
          <p>genuinely hate this class now, its like i said in another one of my entries, i'm the only one that tries to put in any fucking effort. again, just constant anger.</p>
          <p>15:17; in brighter news, i'm getting a haircut. i desperately need, it. my ends are terribly split & dry it's awful. i've also been wanting to cut it shorter for a while now. i want to get shaggy layers & a side bang, if she says it'll look good. my hair right now goes down to my lower back, but i'm going to cut it to the middle of my chest.</p>
          <p>in angrier news: my team and i have a presentation tommorow & i have never been more screwed in my entire life. whatever bro, i should have just dropped out. it'll be good on my college apps though, but whats the point if i don't advance ?</p>

          <p>next week, for one of my clubs, i will be volunteering at a clothing shelter. i'll get some volunteering hours in. good.</p>
          <p>i haven't done yoga in a while, i'll get back on that.</p>
          <p>my neck and back pain is gone, thankfully. it was because of the pillow i was sleeping on. so switching that fixed it. i'm very glad.</p>

          <p>getting very into numerology & tarot. i'm not sure why. it's fun. i like it.</p>
          <p>nothing has been happening, just stress & numbness, per usual.</p>
          <p>working on the <a href="gamedev.html">game</a> some more. today i will finish up the story & start working on the styling.</p>
          <p>yesterday, i cleared off my desk. i put away my monitor & my pc. i'm not using it as much anymore, so it just became clutter. i love the way it looks now, so clean, & so minimal. i also bought clip studio paint today. i want to start drawing again, but every time i do, i end up drawing for an imaginary audience. i've always had this problem since i was young, always pleasing the invisible being that haunts my shoulders every where i go. i used to think that it was god judging my every move. turns out it was anxiety.</p>
          <p>i've actually forgotten that i have anxiety, it's so played down now days. everyone & their mother has it, so no one cares. i also don't care. i do care, because it makes me think i'm going to die if i get in trouble or if i have a calc test.</p>
          <p>met with my tutor yesterday, relearnt trigonometry. it's so simple, i am truly an idiot.</p>
          <p> enjoying silence again. i use sound as a way to cope with my head being too loud.</p>
          <p>i feel as if "my" body & "my" mind are separate things. "my" in quotations because i don't know which is "mine" or which is "me". i present myself as someone who looks intelligent & is emotionally stable but inside i'm a vile being with so much negativity & idiocy. my head says one thing my body does the other. my body moves out of my control. it's as if the two halves of my brain are constantly at war with one another, trying to piss each other off in a petty argument, with my body & my emotions caught in the middle.</p>
          <p>oh well. this weeks the final week of january.</p>

          <p>talked with one of my peers about my english teacher. she is not a good teacher. she does not teach, only rants about current news events. one of my table mates said that she would report her if she didn't improve, i hope she follows through.</p>

          <p>I feel like i'd be able to sleep again like I used to <h6>roshin yuukai</h6></p>
          <p>noticing how everyone is together. how everyone has someone. people are thinking of each other even when they are not there.</p>
          <p>13:49: i don't know if it's my hormones or how i actually am. i deserve it though, even from youth i was a vile parasitic being.</p>

          <h1>1/19</h1>
          <p>two days ago, my gr&father passed away. i wasn't very close to him, given the fact that he is on the other side of the world & we have a pretty big language barrier. he was very sick & possibly had cancer. it sounded like he was in a lot of pain, according to my mother. my father will be leaving tommorow to see him. i don't feel sad, but i'm not fine either. actually i am sad, i wish i talked to him a little more.</p>
          <p>yesterday, i talked with my elder cousin. he has two conures, one named stewie. he didn't say the other ones name. he has a very good relationship with them, & gave me & my brother some tips to get close to ours. he's very nice & mature, we're very much alike.</p>

          <p>i went with my friend to subway, i hadn't seen her in a while.</p>
          <p>so happy she didn't change at all, i missed her so much.</p>
          <p>we just talked for such a long time in there, mostly because i'm a painfully slow eater. but i had such a good time with her. shes so fun to be around, i forget all my problems with her.</p>
          <p>i took a prelim. test for sat tutoring, i'm so mad that i even have to take it, i should know this stuff already. it's incredibly humiliating. but i'm just going to have to face it.</p>
          <p>they didn't tell me my score afterwards, or what i got right or wrong. i wish they did.</p>
          <p>on spring break, i AM getting my license. everyone i have talked to said it was easy, besides the parallel parking part. i thought they would put me on the highway or something, but that's not the case it seems.</p>

        <h1>1/1 - resolutions</h1>
        <p>hello. happy january.</p>
        <p>last year was horrible (but fun), & this one will probably be too. but what is there to do? can't control everything. that's what i've learned from 2024.</p>
        <p>my resolutions for this are divided into two categories. <i>initial</i> & <i>impetus</i>.</p>
        <p><i>initial</i> goals are self explanatory. they are simple goals that i can achieve. one problem i have is that i jump to the end too quickly, end up failed & give up. with these initial goals. i project myself to complete these goals in a few months, but not more than 5. i will hold myself accountable for this.</p>
        <p><i>impetus</i> means "encouragement resulting in increased activity" (Merriam-Webster, 2024). therefore, these goals are meant for the middle of the year, after i've built up momentum from the <i>initial</i> ones. these are going to be harder goals, so i expect to complete them by next year.</p>
        <p>i also have <i>hopes</i>. they are self-explanatory. last year, i didn't actually have any hopes. let's see if this changes anything.</p>
        <p>i've put them in their own page. <a href="nyres.html">here they are</a>.</p>
        <p>there is but one more year till graduation. it's now or never.</p>
