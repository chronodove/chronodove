          <p class="title">1/4 - 20:48</p>
          <p>i lied. i did do something yesterday, i did yoga. i could barely do it though. i'm so weak, both mentally and physically. oh well.</p>
          <p>i'm very nervous for school, but i can't do anything about it. i know that whenever i study i'm going to get things wrong and i convince myself that there's no point. its just an endless cycle of thinking about failing, then failing, then regret.</p>

          <p class="title">1/2 - day out</p>
          <p>today i woke up late. i've been watching kengan asura. i didn't think i'd like it so much. my life is pretty boring, so it's nice to see some action once in a while.</p>
          <p>i went out with my friend to a mall. we had a really good time. she's so funny and amazing. i told her that when me and her sat down in food court. she looked embarrassed. she is such a genuine person, i want to be lke her.</p>
          <p>i bought a polo shirt, graphic tee, & a bra from aeropostale. i also got a mini perfume bottle to put my favourite victorias secret perfume in.</p>
          <p>we only walked for 2 hr's, but my legs hurt. tommorow, i'll do some yoga. i'll also start reviewing math. i've forgotten everything pretty much.</p>
          <p>i'm going to try and sleep on time today.</p>

        <p class="title">1/1 - resolutions</p>
        <p>hello. happy january.</p>
        <p>last year was horrible (but fun), and this one will probably be too. but what is there to do? can't control everything. that's what i've learned from 2024.</p>
        <p>my resolutions for this are divided into two categories. <i>initial</i> and <i>impetus</i>.</p>
        <p><i>initial</i> goals are self explanatory. they are simple goals that i can achieve. one problem i have is that i jump to the end too quickly, end up failed & give up. with these initial goals. i project myself to complete these goals in a few months, but not more than 5. i will hold myself accountable for this.</p>
        <p><i>impetus</i> means "encouragement resulting in increased activity" (Merriam-Webster, 2024). therefore, these goals are meant for the middle of the year, after i've built up momentum from the <i>initial</i> ones. these are going to be harder goals, so i expect to complete them by next year.</p>
        <p>i also have <i>hopes</i>. they are self-explanatory. last year, i didn't actually have any hopes. let's see if this changes anything.</p>
        <p>i've put them in their own page. <a href="nyres.html">here they are</a>.</p>
        <p>there is but one more year till graduation. it's now or never.</p>
