      <p>hello. happy december.</p>
      <p>i spent the break doing nothing. just wandering aimlessly. i get so lazy. for my birthday, which was on thanksgiving, my father took me and my brother to see moana 2, then me and my family took photos. the movie wasn't good, but i'm not a child anymore, so it makes sense. i ate a lot of popcorn. my stomach starting hurting after, but it was worth it. when i got home, my mother made me get ready. i don't like getting ready and doing my hair. i feel fake. yeah i look nice, but i don't want to be reminded i have less than a year till i'm classified as an adult. we tried going to my favourite restaurant, but it was closed. they didn't mention anything on their site that they were going to be closed. i'm still a little mad. my parents were still hungry, so we went to a nearby indian place. my parents ordered a lot of food, they ordered dosas and pakoras. me and my brother ate tandoori chicken. it was spicy. not too bad, but spicy. my brother wanted a lassi, so he got one. i decided to have a sip of it and got a reaction. i thought since it's literally just mango and milk there wouldn't be anything in it. but i was wrong. my throat was super swelled up. i usually tell when i'm having one immediately but this one was a little delayed. i could breathe, but barely swallow. i took benadryl when i got home and immediately slept. i slept for almost 12 hours. </p> 
      <p>i'm going to go to las vegas with my family on my winter break. we have almost 3 weeks off. we are going to go to the grand canyon. i'm very excited. i will take some good photos.</p>
      <p>one month left of 2024. my new years resolution; write everyday. whether it be code or entries like this. just write.</p>
