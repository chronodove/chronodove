                <h2>6/18 - 14:57</h2>
                <p>i got a 75 on my digital class's test. thought it would be better but it's passing,so.</p>
                <p>tomorrow my campus is closed for Juneteenth, i'm going to get my nails done and hopefully find a new pair of boots/sneakers.</p>
                <p>im going to get them shorter so i can actually type, and a black to red gradient. preparing for halloween if you couldn't tell haha.</p>
                <p>next week is my last week of history, and i'm a lot sadder than i thought i would be. i really like my professor, he's very funny and keeps things factual. although he could ease up on the notes a bit, my hand always starts to hurt in that class. <s>he can't really do anything about that though...</s></p>
                <p>so in preparation, i'm applying for so many jobs (got ghosted by my last job), i need something to keep me busy, but they just won't accept me! how are you going to say <i>"urgently hiring"</i> and yet you ghost me?! ugh, what a pain.</p>

                <p>trying to write more often, <a href="https://chronodove.neocities.org/writing">this</a> is just a brain exercise i did. i dissected the reasons as to why i feel so sad often.</p>

                <h2>6/14 - 04:07</h2>
                <p>did my first ever college exams. i got an 83 on my history midterm, a lot better than i was expecting. apparently i wasn't going into detail enough, so i'll have to remember that for the future.</p>
                <p>however, for my other class, i haven't gotten the grades yet. my professor in that class is very much old-school so i'm not surprised by that fact haha.</p>
                <p>i'm really liking college more than highschool, it's a lot quieter. although that could be because it's summer.</p>

                <h2>6/7 - 22:30</h2>
                <p>i had my first interview today! i think it went pretty well.</p>
                <p>he asked me a lot more questions than i thought they would, but hopefully i was confident in answering them enough.</p>
                <p>finally feel like i'm catching up to everyone else.</p>

                <h2>5/31 - 20:43</h2>
                <p>i've finished my first week of CC!</p>
                <p>since it was the first set of classes, everything has been pretty easy so far.</p>
                <p>history has been the easiest, since most of it has just been just paying attention. and to my benefit the subject is a lot more interesting than i thought it would be! my professor is also chill as hell.</p>
                <p>my other class though, it's a bit harder.</p>
                <p>right now it's fine, but i've been trying to study extra hard for it. i actually didn't really understand what he was talking about in the first half of class which was kind of concerning. luckily, he has all the notes and homework assignments online, so as i long as i remember to study, i should be good!</p>
                <p>i'm really liking this so far, it's keeping me and my mind busy. i hate being bored.</p>

                <h2>5/27 - 21:18</h2>
                <p>tomorrow is my first day at a community college.</p>
                <p>my high school offers a dual credit program at a local community college for free, it allows high school students to complete some of their credits needed early. although i'm just going so i can skip some of my classes like u.s history.</p>
                <p>it's pretty nerveracking, but i'm surprised i'm not as anxious as i thought i would be. i'm actually more excited!</p>
                <p>this is definitely going to be good for me, getting used to how college assignments work and all. i'll need this since i'll be taking 6 AP's next year...</p>
                <p>this will also mean more updates to this site(by site i mean this journal/diary)!! yay!!</p>
