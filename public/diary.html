              <p>yesterday was very uneventful. i slept immediately after i came home from school. my mother and brother went to a diwali party next door, and he came home at eight - interrupting my sleep - and asked me to make him something to eat. i made him some food and tried to go back to sleep. i went to sleep around 22 and woke up at 3. i slept again at 6 and woke up to feed the birds at 7.</p> 
              <p>my younger cousin from india called me, i hadn't talked to her in over 2 years. we had a very nice conversation, though she cut out a lot, so i ended up just smiling and laughing most of the time. she made fun of how whitewashed i was. it didn't take it personally, she's not wrong. i don't speak hindi well, and i can only understand up to almost 4th standard level. she's otherwise very sweet. she is a lot like me. she's getting along very well with my father. i hope i get to go to india again and catch up.</p>
              <p>after that i took another nap. i woke up at four. now i have been up since. i was very lazy yesterday. maybe i'll make it up today, or tommorow. who knows.</p>
              <p>my mother and brother went to another party. they haven't come back yet at the time of writing. i helped her get ready. i just stared at her and came to the realization that she was my mother. i get that feeling often where i think, "wow, this woman gave birth to me. she isn't some woman i happen to live with right now." same thing happens with my father too. i have no idea why.</p>
              <p>i found some very interesting sites today and followed them. i also tried to make a new button but it didn't work out. i'll try again later.</p>

              <p>i miss my dad, he's coming back on the 9th though.</p>
              <p>i cant wait for this weekend. i'm going to nap. i want to take a nap outside but i don't want bugs crawling all over me, i like bugs but i like keeping my distance from them more.</p>

            <p>frustrated. i'm either feeling nothing or everything depending on if i took my meds or not. i'm crying over nothing or not crying at all. nothing is consistent.</p>

            <p>cage didn't come today. ugh.</p>
            <p>been bonding more with the birds. so far my progress with ray is going well. i can keep my hand next to him, and he wont fly away. he also knows to "step up" on a separate perch.</p>
            <p>chiku however is still scared.</p>
            <p>i ordered a new toy and it came today, it's a big green ball with a bell inside. it's more-so meant for parrots but i think it'll be okay for the budgies as well. the bath dish came as well. ray was interested and tried to get to it but he couldn't. i placed a ramp leading up to it, so hopefully one of them gets a chance to try it.</p>
            <p>more toys will be coming tomorrow, along with the cage. i think they are little bored, so as stressful as that will be to them, it will also give them something to do.</p>
            <p>i also got some pellets to give to them as well, so they don't fill up just on seeds alone.</p>

            <p>yesterday me and my brother got budgies. we have a temp cage for them as my dad got a very large one off of amazon.</p>
            <p>i feel a lot of dread..? for some reason..?</p>
            <p>it's probably the responsibility that i'm facing now. i have to take care of a living breathing bird.</p>
            <p>the budgies were actually my moms idea, i don't know how or where she got the idea from (maybe the dove?).</p>

              <p>unfortunately the new cage did not come today.</p>
              <p>they don't have a lot of toys right now and i feel so horrible about it, but at least they have each other. but ray doesn't like chiku touching him.</p>
              <p>the dread is still here, i can't figure out the cause of it. is it because of the responsibility? or is it my inability to accept change?</p>
              <p>i'll try my best. they didn't ask to be rehomed by me.</p>

              <p>a mourning dove was getting hunted by a falcon and ran into my window. she flew so hard she left an imprint.</p>
              <p>she fell to the bottom of our porch, stunned by the impact and bleeding through her ear. her eye was also bloody. my brother and I accompanied her, trying to give her water, but she didn't drink. we layed her down in a sunny patch of grass and left her alone for a bit.</p>
              <p>it seemed that she was getting a bit better, she started to fly and after i identified her she flew on to our roof.</p>
              <p>i was worried that we would find her dead tomorrow but, maybe she'll be alright. or the falcon will come back to finish what it's started.</p>
              <p>i can't imagine being her. so much pain she must be in. it's times like this i wish i didn't have a heart. why am i hurting for a bird so much?</p>
              <p>still, the way her racing heart beat so hard that her body moved, and how even though she was prepared to die, she still flew. there's something meaningful in that.</p>

                <p>i got a 75 on my digital class's test. thought it would be better but it's passing,so.</p>
                <p>tomorrow my campus is closed for Juneteenth, i'm going to get my nails done and hopefully find a new pair of boots/sneakers.</p>
                <p>im going to get them shorter so i can actually type, and a black to red gradient. preparing for halloween if you couldn't tell haha.</p>
                <p>next week is my last week of history, and i'm a lot sadder than i thought i would be. i really like my professor, he's very funny and keeps things factual. although he could ease up on the notes a bit, my hand always starts to hurt in that class. <s>he can't really do anything about that though...</s></p>
                <p>so in preparation, i'm applying for so many jobs (got ghosted by my last job), i need something to keep me busy, but they just won't accept me! how are you going to say <i>"urgently hiring"</i> and yet you ghost me?! ugh, what a pain.</p>

                <p>did my first ever college exams. i got an 83 on my history midterm, a lot better than i was expecting. apparently i wasn't going into detail enough, so i'll have to remember that for the future.</p>
                <p>however, for my other class, i haven't gotten the grades yet. my professor in that class is very much old-school so i'm not surprised by that fact haha.</p>
                <p>i'm really liking college more than highschool, it's a lot quieter. although that could be because it's summer.</p>

                <p>i had my first interview today! i think it went pretty well.</p>
                <p>he asked me a lot more questions than i thought they would, but hopefully i was confident in answering them enough.</p>
                <p>finally feel like i'm catching up to everyone else.</p>

                <p>i've finished my first week of CC!</p>
                <p>since it was the first set of classes, everything has been pretty easy so far.</p>
                <p>history has been the easiest, since most of it has just been just paying attention. and to my benefit the subject is a lot more interesting than i thought it would be! my professor is also chill as hell.</p>
                <p>my other class though, it's a bit harder.</p>
                <p>right now it's fine, but i've been trying to study extra hard for it. i actually didn't really understand what he was talking about in the first half of class which was kind of concerning. luckily, he has all the notes and homework assignments online, so as i long as i remember to study, i should be good!</p>
                <p>i'm really liking this so far, it's keeping me and my mind busy. i hate being bored.</p>

                <h2>5/27 - 21:18</h2>
                <p>tomorrow is my first day at a community college.</p>
                <p>my high school offers a dual credit program at a local community college for free, it allows high school students to complete some of their credits needed early. although i'm just going so i can skip some of my classes like u.s history.</p>
                <p>it's pretty nerveracking, but i'm surprised i'm not as anxious as i thought i would be. i'm actually more excited!</p>
                <p>this is definitely going to be good for me, getting used to how college assignments work and all. i'll need this since i'll be taking 6 AP's next year...</p>
                <p>this will also mean more updates to this site(by site i mean this journal/diary)!! yay!!</p>
