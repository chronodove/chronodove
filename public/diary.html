            <p>i woke up this morning and saw that it was thursday. i felt so disappointed.</p>
            <p>i deleted my instagram account yesterday. i've already been feeling a lot better, it was just constant noise i was shoving into my head. but now i've replaced it with reddit. at least i'm using my head a little bit by reading.</p>
            <p>i've still just been going home and lying in my bed for the rest of the day. i have no energy to even go to my computer. it's probably because i haven't been eating at all/not well. i get this habit when i'm stressed. i just don't feel hungry, like genuinely. it's not like i'm suppressing the feeling, i don't get it in the first place. but i've been trying to cut off on sodas for a bit, it's starting to hurt my stomach.</p>
            <p>on better news, the weather is finally becoming a little colder, really feels like fall. it's quite windy, but not so much so that it becomes cold. yesterday i discovered that i liked the feeling of wind.</p>
            <p>i have a physics quiz, i was supposed to go to her in order to take it, but i didn't have my notes and i forgot to visit her. i feel bad.</p>
            <p>my gpa is higher than i thought it was. my unweighted is 3.6 and weighted is 4.2. i thought it was 3.1 and 3.2. that boosted my mood a little bit.</p>

            <p>i've been binging hell's kitchen for the past 2 weeks. there no reason to this. it's just one of the shows i have on my "binge-cycle"</p>

              <p>it's a day before the four day weekend, so everything is pretty easy right now. thats why i keep writing. i failed my compsci quiz, but i don't care anymore.</p>
              <p>there is this girl in my class, she came in cosplay. she reminds me of me when i was younger. gushing about a fictional character to anyone who listens, and unfortunately that happens to be my teacher. she hasn't stopped talking for over 10 minutes now. my teacher is very patient. he's my favourite, actually. he's very down to earth and doesn't try to do much. he just teaches. it's very nice, i like straight-forward people.</p>

              <p>i am going to replace these images with paintings, i have a four day weekend. i am going to rest.</p>
              <p>in light of yesterdays breakdown i had, i am going to go work on my essay with my seminar teacher after school. i hate how vulnerable i am. i don't want to go, but i cannot leave her hanging. she handed me my essay score and said that it wasn't bad, just short. i don't believe her. it was awful. awful awful awful. word of the day: awful.</p>

              <p>yesterday was awful. awful awful awful</p>
              <p>i went to go to my counselor, Mrs. G, for some advice to drop out. for some reason everything was just so overwhelming and i burt out into tears right then and there. i tried to run away but it was too late. she was grabbing the tissue box and placing it next to me. she kept reassuring me and saying its okay but its not. i am an idiot. they all say the same things over and over and over and over. she gave me a little coil ring. i used next period and managed to break it.</p>
              <p>like the coward i am, she told my seminar teacher, Mrs. GF, about me, and my request to leave. after lunch, i went to that period. she at first didn't acknowledge me until she called people up to talk about the essay. i noticed that she skipped me. i continued working however, since we are working on a team project. they do not deserve to suffer because i am a horrible person.</p>
              <p>after class she told me to stay, and my stomach sank. i told her i had a physics quiz (which wasn't a lie!) but she made me stay. i couldn't look her in the eyes. she said the same things as Mrs G. i was so tired, that i said the first thing that came to my head, "i'm an idiot"</p>
              <p>she went on to say that i wasn't but i don't believe her. she doesn't know anything about me. nobody know anything about me.</p>

              <p>i did not go to the library yesterday. i was so exhausted. i am so disappointed. i want for just one day be in a different body, a more capable one. one thats not as useless as this.</p>
              <p>my dad is leaving for india tommorow. my grandfather is very sick. i wasn't very close to him on account of the language barrier, but my dad is very upset about it. he is like me (or am i like him?) in the way we just tune out in periods of stress. not talking to anyone. just going about our day trying desperately not to talk about whatever is bothering us. he is going to be gone for two weeks. the last time he left for this long was just over two years ago. i can't remember much, but i do remember missing him a lot. my mom also left for a long period as well. she went through a depressive episode in november, she hasn't said what it was about or why it happened. she went to canada to be with her sister for a month. when she came back, she looked much better. my dad, my brother and i were just eating out for the past month and we were sick of it. our neighbor had actually dropped off some homemade food for us and he ate it all in just an hour. i hadn't seen him like that before</p>

              <p>i skipped school yesterday. just thinking about s*minar makes me sick. i'm paralyzed whenever i try to work on it. i don't have an excuse though, i'm just an idiot.</p>
              <p>i took it easy yesterday, i did my math homework. i felt guilty lying in bed all day. i went to the dentist too. i don't like going to the dentist. i hate when they bring multiple people in like i'm some kind of specimen.</p>
              <p>i sang, also. i haven't sang since last year. my voice is awful, even while it was really quiet. but i liked it. i sang strobe light by siinamota. the last time i had listened to that song was 2 years ago. when i thought everything couldn't get worse. needless to say i was wrong. as usual.</p>
              <p>i don't know why i am trying. i am going to die either way, i  will not leave a lasting imprint on future generations, so there is no point. even if i don't die, i will just be a miserable adult working an miserable 40hr job for 40 years until i die alone and cold. why not just skip over that and get straight to the point. quit while i'm still ahead. </p>

              <p>i am going to the library after school. i will focus on my essay. i hope to get it done. i am going to write more than 1 sentence. i will also try to finish my computer science code. i will not procrastinate. the sooner it's done the sooner i get to sleep. i am still going to drop out, but if i'm going to quit i wont quit pathetically.</p>
              <p>i am also writing a short story!! i am actually excited about it, i really like it so far. i haven't written anything like a story since 5th grade...</p>
              <p>i've been working on it since september, but i'm using "working" very loosely as i forgot it existed until now. i want to make it a project, i update throughout the year and mark timestamps what i did. then i can see if my writing style has changed at all. i think it'll be fun.</p>

              <p>i've been listening to vocaloid again. i always end up going back to it when i get into a depressive rut. it's been a part of me since middle school. i remember how comforting it was to read the english lyrics of rolling girl and feeling like someone understood me.</p>

              <p>ray died yesterday. both my birds are dead. we didn't get an autopsy done on them. i'll never know what i did wrong.</p>
              <p>i took the psat yesterday. it was horrible. not just because i had to see my dead bird's body before i left to school, but also because everyone around me said it was easy. the guy next to me, insisted that i did good. what the hell does he know? how can you just assume something about someone right to their face? i don't care if it was "supposed to make me feel better", you don't know anything about me. you don't even know i'm writing about you, and yet you decide to make the bold claim that i did <i>great</i>.</p>
              <p>i don't know how they do it. how confident they are. how positive they are. it genuinely makes me sick. i'm so miserable that any positivity that comes my way churns my stomach. "i should quit while i'm still ahead." that phrase keeps circling around in my head. it has been for the past 2 days, since chiku died. it's only going to get worse, might as well quit while i'm still ahead.</p>
              <p>i had a math test today, it wasn't that bad. it was still bad, and i definitely didn't pass (i don't pass any test anymore), but it wasn't that big of a train-wreck. but now saying that i definitely failed. this is how i always think, and then i get the score. 37/100, 57/100, 64/100.alongside that i had an english "exam." it wasn't really an exam like in a traditional sense, we had to write a thesis, draft an outline, write a body paragraph, and explain why we chose to do specific things in the body paragraph. i'm okay at english, so i didn't find it too challenging. it was hard coming up with evidence though, so i just wrote down whatever bullshit i thought of at that moment.</p>
              <p>i have an essay to write due by monday. i have 2/5 paragraphs needed. i don't like writing this essay, i don't have any more claims to make. it's just going to be a drag. i need to finish it though. just get it done so i can stop thinking about it.</p>

              <p>i've had thoughts like this for as long as i can remember, since middle school. i was envious of my (then) boyfriends friends. he gave them so much more attention than me, and i knew him longer than he did with them. he avoided me as if i was some airborne disease. we used to talk everyday and it all just stopped. before he moved, he gave me a sorry excuse apology. i accepted it, told him it's not his fault and that i still loved him. i don't remember what he said after that. i think that was the beginning of when i got more jealous of people.</p>
              <p>since then, i still find myself reminisce about him and the times we had together. he was going through so much, i hope he's okay now. but i also hope that he doesn't forget what he did, and how much he had hurt me as well, even if he didn't mean to. i really do hope he's happy. we live in the same state, maybe one day we'll cross paths again.</p>

            <p>miserably failed my math test monday, ruined my entire week.</p>
            <p>i still don't even know how that happened. i genuinely took time out of my day to prepare.</p>
            <p>same thing happened in my college class, the more i study the worse my grade ends up. how does that even make sense?????</p>
            <p>whatever, my dreams of being an "academic weapon" sailed a long time ago, i don't know why i keep thinking things change. they don't. i'm stuck here. i'm too sensitive over academics.</p>
            <p>but my practice sat scores have been improving, little by little. so i must be doing something right.</p>
            <p>on a different note, i have an entrepreneur class, and we are making a product. my team were in a big disagreement over what to do so we picked the first option we could. our usb noticed that and proceeded to humiliate in front of the whole class. why would you do something like that. it pissed me off so much. i don't care if "this is how the business world is", you still don't just do that to people. i couldn't talk to my team after that. i was so pissed. one of my team members doesn't even do anything. he just sits there. it's not like we even interrupt him or anything, he has plenty of chances to put in some effort, but he just DOESN'T. oh well, what to do? i'm not his mother, i'm not going to lecture him like one.</p>
            <p>i forgot how nice it is to write down things. it really does feel like opening up my brain and dumping everything out. i should do it more often.</p>

            <p>cage didn't come today. ugh.</p>
            <p>been bonding more with the birds. so far my progress with ray is going well. i can keep my hand next to him, and he wont fly away. he also knows to "step up" on a separate perch.</p>
            <p>chiku however is still scared.</p>
            <p>i ordered a new toy and it came today, it's a big green ball with a bell inside. it's more-so meant for parrots but i think it'll be okay for the budgies as well. the bath dish came as well. ray was interested and tried to get to it but he couldn't. i placed a ramp leading up to it, so hopefully one of them gets a chance to try it.</p>
            <p>more toys will be coming tomorrow, along with the cage. i think they are little bored, so as stressful as that will be to them, it will also give them something to do.</p>
            <p>i also got some pellets to give to them as well, so they don't fill up just on seeds alone.</p>

              <p>a mourning dove was getting hunted by a falcon and ran into my window. she flew so hard she left an imprint.</p>
              <p>she fell to the bottom of our porch, stunned by the impact and bleeding through her ear. her eye was also bloody. my brother and I accompanied her, trying to give her water, but she didn't drink. we layed her down in a sunny patch of grass and left her alone for a bit.</p>
              <p>it seemed that she was getting a bit better, she started to fly and after i identified her she flew on to our roof.</p>
              <p>i was worried that we would find her dead tomorrow but, maybe she'll be alright. or the falcon will come back to finish what it's started.</p>
              <p>i can't imagine being her. so much pain she must be in. it's times like this i wish i didn't have a heart. why am i hurting for a bird so much?</p>
              <p>still, the way her racing heart beat so hard that her body moved, and how even though she was prepared to die, she still flew. there's something meaningful in that.</p>

                <p>i got a 75 on my digital class's test. thought it would be better but it's passing,so.</p>
                <p>tomorrow my campus is closed for Juneteenth, i'm going to get my nails done and hopefully find a new pair of boots/sneakers.</p>
                <p>im going to get them shorter so i can actually type, and a black to red gradient. preparing for halloween if you couldn't tell haha.</p>
                <p>next week is my last week of history, and i'm a lot sadder than i thought i would be. i really like my professor, he's very funny and keeps things factual. although he could ease up on the notes a bit, my hand always starts to hurt in that class. <s>he can't really do anything about that though...</s></p>
                <p>so in preparation, i'm applying for so many jobs (got ghosted by my last job), i need something to keep me busy, but they just won't accept me! how are you going to say <i>"urgently hiring"</i> and yet you ghost me?! ugh, what a pain.</p>

                <p>trying to write more often, <a href="https://chronodove.neocities.org/writing">this</a> is just a brain exercise i did. i dissected the reasons as to why i feel so sad often.</p>

                <h2>6/14 - 04:07</h2>
                <p>did my first ever college exams. i got an 83 on my history midterm, a lot better than i was expecting. apparently i wasn't going into detail enough, so i'll have to remember that for the future.</p>
                <p>however, for my other class, i haven't gotten the grades yet. my professor in that class is very much old-school so i'm not surprised by that fact haha.</p>
                <p>i'm really liking college more than highschool, it's a lot quieter. although that could be because it's summer.</p>

                <p>i had my first interview today! i think it went pretty well.</p>
                <p>he asked me a lot more questions than i thought they would, but hopefully i was confident in answering them enough.</p>
                <p>finally feel like i'm catching up to everyone else.</p>

                <h2>5/31 - 20:43</h2>
                <p>i've finished my first week of CC!</p>
                <p>since it was the first set of classes, everything has been pretty easy so far.</p>
                <p>history has been the easiest, since most of it has just been just paying attention. and to my benefit the subject is a lot more interesting than i thought it would be! my professor is also chill as hell.</p>
                <p>my other class though, it's a bit harder.</p>
                <p>right now it's fine, but i've been trying to study extra hard for it. i actually didn't really understand what he was talking about in the first half of class which was kind of concerning. luckily, he has all the notes and homework assignments online, so as i long as i remember to study, i should be good!</p>
                <p>i'm really liking this so far, it's keeping me and my mind busy. i hate being bored.</p>

                <h2>5/27 - 21:18</h2>
                <p>tomorrow is my first day at a community college.</p>
                <p>my high school offers a dual credit program at a local community college for free, it allows high school students to complete some of their credits needed early. although i'm just going so i can skip some of my classes like u.s history.</p>
                <p>it's pretty nerveracking, but i'm surprised i'm not as anxious as i thought i would be. i'm actually more excited!</p>
                <p>this is definitely going to be good for me, getting used to how college assignments work and all. i'll need this since i'll be taking 6 AP's next year...</p>
                <p>this will also mean more updates to this site(by site i mean this journal/diary)!! yay!!</p>
