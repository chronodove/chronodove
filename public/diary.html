          <h1>1/16 - rage</h1>
          <p>11:54 - feeling nothing but rage recently. i spend half an hour writing a script and these assholes discarded it & "um"-d & "like"-d through the entire presentation, sounding just so bored. is it that hard to sound a <i>little</i> happier? is it really that hard? i feel like i'm the only one that fucking cares. i write the scripts, i make the presentations, i fill out the assignment, & all i want in return is just a little, TINY amount of passion. i wanted to be in this class to succeed, but with these people i can't imagine us making it to the final pitch, let alone fucking wining. it's not all their fault though, it's just so frustrating. as long as i still have the passion, this project won't die. i just need to make it to may & be done with everything.</p>

AND that bitch got a higher score than me, what a perfect little fucking asshole. i didn't get the lowest score in the class, so i have that. but what different does that make, i'm still shit. its like the quote "why does that matter? i am still ugly and he is still god."</p>

          <h1>1/11 - forgot</h1>
          <p>forgot to post yesterdays entry. whoops.</p>
          <p>i went with my friend to subway, i hadn't seen her in a while.</p>
          <p>so happy she didn't change at all, i missed her so much.</p>
          <p>we just talked for such a long time in there, mostly because i'm a painfully slow eater. but i had such a good time with her. shes so fun to be around, i forget all my problems with her.</p>
          <p>i took a prelim. test for sat tutoring, i'm so mad that i even have to take it, i should know this stuff already. it's incredibly humiliating. but i'm just going to have to face it.</p>
          <p>they didn't tell me my score afterwards, or what i got right or wrong. i wish they did.</p>
          <p>on spring break, i AM getting my license. everyone i have talked to said it was easy, besides the parallel parking part. i thought they would put me on the highway or something, but that's not the case it seems.</p>

          <h1>1/6 - 19:28</h1>
          <p>yoga again today. body hurt a little less. tommorow, i'm going to try a shorter routine. forgot to take medication.</p>
          <p>finished kengan ashura. hated the ending. but i'll read the sequel manga, i like the art style.</p>
          <p>watching a new show, <i>The Glory</i>. liking it a lot so far. hope it doesn't have a stupid ending like kengan.</p>

          <h1>1/5 - your did it</h1>
          <p>made it through the entire yoga routine. my legs hurt but it gave the energy i needed. pathetic that it took this long, but at least i did. i keep whining about stuff, this year i'll change. </p>

          <h1>1/4 - 20:48</h1>
          <p>i lied. i did do something yesterday, i did yoga. i could barely do it though. i'm so weak, both mentally and physically. oh well.</p>
          <p>i'm very nervous for school, but i can't do anything about it. i know that whenever i study i'm going to get things wrong and i convince myself that there's no point. its just an endless cycle of thinking about failing, then failing, then regret.</p>

          <h1>1/2 - day out</h1>
          <p>today i woke up late. i've been watching kengan asura. i didn't think i'd like it so much. my life is pretty boring, so it's nice to see some action once in a while.</p>
          <p>i went out with my friend to a mall. we had a really good time. she's so funny and amazing. i told her that when me and her sat down in food court. she looked embarrassed. she is such a genuine person, i want to be lke her.</p>
          <p>i bought a polo shirt, graphic tee, & a bra from aeropostale. i also got a mini perfume bottle to put my favourite victorias secret perfume in.</p>
          <p>we only walked for 2 hr's, but my legs hurt. tommorow, i'll do some yoga. i'll also start reviewing math. i've forgotten everything pretty much.</p>
          <p>i'm going to try and sleep on time today.</p>

        <h1>1/1 - resolutions</h1>
        <p>hello. happy january.</p>
        <p>last year was horrible (but fun), and this one will probably be too. but what is there to do? can't control everything. that's what i've learned from 2024.</p>
        <p>my resolutions for this are divided into two categories. <i>initial</i> and <i>impetus</i>.</p>
        <p><i>initial</i> goals are self explanatory. they are simple goals that i can achieve. one problem i have is that i jump to the end too quickly, end up failed & give up. with these initial goals. i project myself to complete these goals in a few months, but not more than 5. i will hold myself accountable for this.</p>
        <p><i>impetus</i> means "encouragement resulting in increased activity" (Merriam-Webster, 2024). therefore, these goals are meant for the middle of the year, after i've built up momentum from the <i>initial</i> ones. these are going to be harder goals, so i expect to complete them by next year.</p>
        <p>i also have <i>hopes</i>. they are self-explanatory. last year, i didn't actually have any hopes. let's see if this changes anything.</p>
        <p>i've put them in their own page. <a href="nyres.html">here they are</a>.</p>
        <p>there is but one more year till graduation. it's now or never.</p>
