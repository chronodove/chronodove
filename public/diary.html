        <p>hello. happy january.</p>
        <p>last year was horrible (but fun), and this one will probably be too. but what is there to do? can't control everything. that's what i've learned from 2024.</p>
        <p>my resolutions for this are divided into two categories. <i>initial</i> and <i>impetus</i>.</p>
        <p><i>initial</i> goals are self explanatory. they are simple goals that i can achieve. one problem i have is that i jump to the end too quickly, end up failed & give up. with these initial goals. i project myself to complete these goals in a few months, but not more than 5. i will hold myself accountable for this.</p>
        <p><i>impetus</i> means "encouragement resulting in increased activity" (Merriam-Webster, 2024). therefore, these goals are meant for the middle of the year, after i've built up momentum from the <i>initial</i> ones. these are going to be harder goals, so i expect to complete them by next year.</p>
        <p>i also have <i>hopes</i>. they are self-explanatory. last year, i didn't actually have any hopes. let's see if this changes anything.</p>
        <p>i've put them in their own page. <a href="nyres.html">here they are</a>.</p>
        <p>there is but one more year till graduation. it's now or never.</p>
