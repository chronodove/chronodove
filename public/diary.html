           <p>05:55; it's weird looking back at old photos of my parents and going through their old data drives. it's almost like sonder, but on a more personal level. i often have a selfish way of thinking about them, as they are <b>my</b> parents, but when sifting through their photos and their files, i'm reminded that they are their own people. they didn't start exisiting when i was born. it's humbling.</p>

           <p>today was fun!</p>
           <p>first, i went to college to take my first exam. it went okay, i knew some of the questions and didn't know like two of them.</p>
           <p>afterwards, i had lunch and went out with my mom to get new clothes for my trip. i bought a really cute white dress and another black one. i also got some bra's and silver necklaces.</p>
           <p>finally, i went out with my english friend group to a ramen place. the ramen was good, but the portion size was really big, so i didn't finish it. i did however try black tea, which was a lot better than i thought it would be, considering i'm not a very big fan of tea. it was really nice to hang out with more than one person, i didn't feel like i was left out too much. they are all much more intelligeint than me, but they don't constantly talk about academics, so it's a litter better for my ego that way. they all looked very beautiful and pretty. </p>
           <p>before i left, my camera came and i am in love with it. it is a <b>nikon coolpx 4600</b>. it is so small and cute!!! it's actually perfect for travelling, as it uses batteries instead of needing to charge and i cannot stress how small it is!!</p>
           <p>on saturday, i had my drivers exam. i passed! though it is not impressive, considering how easy the exam was. i have my appointment with the dmv on july 7th, then i'll be able to drive by myself! i've been brainstorming ideas on where to go, but it is overwhelming.</p>
           <p>overall, today was good. i'm tired though, i don't go out this much. i'm excited for new york. i think i'll start working on my photography page.</p>

            <p>hello. it's been a while.</p>
           <p>i don't have anythign say. i didn't two months ago & i don't now.</p>
           <p>i've been messing around with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> & <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. its helped a lot with learning css & javascript, as well as more advanced techniques in javascript.</p>
           <p>other than that, i've been reflecting a lot; mainly on what i want to do in the future. i've decided on mechanical engineering for now, but i sway between that & electrical engineering. i love the both of them, but the latter is notoriously difficult. it's fascinating though, electricity & working with circuits. i even considered vet school.</p>
           <p>i've narrowed down my list of colleges that i want to go to, most of them are >50% acceptance rate, as to not damage my ego too much. i've also gotten a letter of reccomendation. i'm going to attend a virtual admissions overview tonight for one of them. i'm also attending my local communtity college for high school credit. currently, i'm taking macroeconomics. i would havbe taken micro but there were no campuses close to me offering that class in person. i cannot do online learning. when that class is over, i have government next. then nothing.</p>
           <p>i took the sat again last weekend, i studied with my tutor. i didn't eat anything that entire week. i have the act in july. all my scores need to be higher</p>
           <p>i have my driving exam this saturday on the fourtheeth. it is with my local driving school, so all i have to do is parallel park & drive around in a neighborhood. the more difficult part will be patiently waiting for my DMV appointment in july to officially get the license.</p>
           <p>i've just been in the same cycle as usual, being happy  & motivated, dipping into sadness, being miserable  & wailing, then slowly crawling back up. i want to be more creative  & write more. its so frustrating being a woman.</p>
           <p>on the 18th i'll be going to new york, i think i might get a new (HOPEFULLY CHEAP!!!!!) camera to take photos. i'm really excited. my childhood stuffed animal is from there,  & i'd love to visit the store that she's from.</p>
           <p>i think i'm going to get my nose pierced.</p>
           <p><b>19:33;</b> i forgot i had a webinar for one of my colleges. oops. luckily i made it in time. the college seems like a really good place, i'm very excited to go if i get accepted. it's far away from where i live, but it's a lot like my old home. i can't wait. although, the idea of being truly alone is daunting, but thrilling at the same time.</p>
