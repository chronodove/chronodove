      <p>procrastinating a lot, now i'm paying the price. so sleepy.</p>
      <p>i had my history test today, i kinda cheated from the guy in front of me. i didn't just blindly copy his answers though. it was easy (not just because of that.)</p>
      <p>tommorow i have a spanish speaking test. i really hate those kinds of tests. i just have so much work to do, ughhh.</p>

      <p>i took my exam today. the second math module was horrible. i had no idea what was happening. lots of trig. english was fine for the most part. when i got home, i napped for around 5 hours.</p>
      <p>i've found myself a new technique to help me sleep. i saw it on reddit. you begin by tensing up every part of your body, top to body & one at a time, keep that tension for 3-4 seconds, then release whilst breathing slowly. i'm not sure how to describe it, but after that each of my limbs are filled with warmth and it relaxes me completely.</p>
      <p>yesterday, i told myself that i wasn't going to sleep with any sound. i don't know where i got that idea from, but it was the right choice. as soon as i placed my head on my pillow, it started to rain.</p>
      <p>the air inside my house has been really dry, i started up my air humidifier in my room. i put too much essential oil and now my head hurts.</p>

      <p>today was weird.</p>
      <p>math was hard & frustrating. i am so bad at math. it's a miracle i've gotten this far.</p>
      <p>english was replaced by a "party." we were all required to attend. i brought my laptop with me to work on my site. but there were so many people that i became self conscious. all i could think was "i want to leave" the entire hour. it was only an hour, but it felt like four. i kept looking at the door, expecting someone to come sit with me. i don't know who i was expecting. then, a group of boys sat down at my table. the blond one said, "hey he (points to his friend) has a crush on you." i felt my cheeks getting hot. i buried my palm into one of them & ignored him. i left after that. i ended just standing around for the rest of the event. i wanted to read a new book i had picked up, but i couldn't. i was upset about that.</p>
      <p>it was freezing today. very cold. reminded me of home. the cold was painful, yet healing at the same time. it took my mind off of myself & other people. for once.</p>
      <p>i bought a lot of toys for--practically--my budgies. i asked reddit for advice. i got them more toys & perches. i also got them a ladder. i accidentally scared one of them whilst i was setting up the base for a little bath i bought some time ago (i initially gave up because i was installing it the wrong way & didn't know it). i felt bad. i sat down with him until he started to climb back up.</p>
      <p>tommorow is my sat. i haven't been able to sleep. just paralyzed with stress & fear.</p>
      <p>i reinstalled hyprland. the last time i had it was 5 months ago. i thought it was longer. once i tidy up my files, i think i'll share them. it's nothing special, but classy enough for me.</p>

        <p>hello. happy december.</p>
        <p>i spent the break doing nothing. just wandering aimlessly. i get so lazy. for my birthday, which was on thanksgiving, my father took me and my brother to see moana 2, then me and my family took photos. the movie wasn't good, but i'm not a child anymore, so it makes sense. i ate a lot of popcorn. my stomach starting hurting after, but it was worth it. when i got home, my mother made me get ready. i don't like getting ready and doing my hair. i feel fake. yeah i look nice, but i don't want to be reminded i have less than a year till i'm classified as an adult. we tried going to my favourite restaurant, but it was closed. they didn't mention anything on their site that they were going to be closed. i'm still a little mad. my parents were still hungry, so we went to a nearby indian place. my parents ordered a lot of food, they ordered dosas and pakoras. me and my brother ate tandoori chicken. it was spicy. not too bad, but spicy. my brother wanted a lassi, so he got one. i decided to have a sip of it and got a reaction. i thought since it's literally just mango and milk there wouldn't be anything in it. but i was wrong. my throat was super swelled up. i usually tell when i'm having one immediately but this one was a little delayed. i could breathe, but barely swallow. i took benadryl when i got home and immediately slept. i slept for almost 12 hours. </p> 
        <p>i'm going to go to las vegas with my family on my winter break. we have almost 3 weeks off. we are going to go to the grand canyon. i'm very excited. i will take some good photos.</p>
        <p>one month left of 2024. my new years resolution; write everyday. whether it be code or entries like this. just write.</p>
