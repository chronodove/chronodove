              <p>i finished my seminar essay this morning. finally, thank god it's done. our real essay is coming up, and i'm excited. i love writing about things i'm passionate about. we get to choose the topic for this one. i never ever EVER want to hear the words "politcal polarization" (what i needed to write about) EVER again.</p>

              <p>on a more positive note, the birds are doing well. i've been so sad i haven't been able to sit with them. i'm sitting with them right now and their little chirps are just, so, so adorable. paired with their little fluffy bodies and big black eyes, it's the perfect recipe for cuteness aggression. they make me a lot happier, just like chiku and ray did. i miss them everyday.</p>

                <p>today i am presenting with my group. our script it way to long and borders on 20 minutes. i say very little, i'm debating on if i should ask the for more parts or use this to my advantage. for that i am dressed very nicely. i used to dress nicely in freshmen year almost everyday for the first semester before i became exhausted. i still dress well, but i usually don't wear makeup or jewelry. i wanted to wear earring everyday for school this year but now i only wear them once week.</p>
                <p>i don't know why i keep trying to change, it's clear that i won't.</p>
                <p>miserably failed my calc quiz yesterday, was upset about it the whole day.i still kind of am. i kept saying to myself that i don't care but the more i said that the more i cared and the more i sobbed. i have the passion but not the desire.</p>

              <p>my first day back is almost over. it was okay for the most part.</p>
              <p>spanish was fine, as always. we don't really do anything interesting, just fill out some papers. i hate listening to all the conversations though. i feel like i'm behind whenever i listen to them pass their tests and study for the sat and go out with friends and actually have a future unlike yours truly !!!</p>
              <p>entrepreneurship was fun, i really like my team. they are nice, especially Y. he's very sweet, he reminds me of a puppy. he's adorable. we had to present an elevator pitch to the class, i wrote it like half an hour and it turned out good!</p>
              <p>now it's the dreaded seminar. it was a work day, my team and i have to finish our presentation script and practice it tonight. we are face timing. i really really really really don't want to, but i'm not going to leave them hanging. plus there are teammate evaluations at the end i don't want to get a bad grade.</p>
              <p>the cycle starts again. i just have to make it two more weeks though, then it will be thanksgiving break.</p>

              <p>very very homesick</p>
              <p>i don't think i'll ever be able to truly forgive my parents for moving me here, let alone on such a short notice. i never got to really say goodbye to my home. one i knew for 15 years. i miss the winter and fall there. i miss the quiet sounds at night and the people. i miss waking up and seeing a pristine layer of snow and the robins and bluejays on our deck. i can't wait for college. i will apply to their state university and live there again, happily.</p>
              <p>but for now, i must deal with where i am, begrudgingly. i did a little bit of my calc homework this morning with my brothers birds. they are not mine, i didn't want them. i haven't gotten over chiku and ray. i sat yesterday in front of their graves in our yard. i miss them so much.</p>
              <p>i hope to finish the rest of my homework today, and start completing my english reading. i have to read 20 pages of very dense text by wednesday, so the sooner i start the better.</p>

              <p>yesterday was very uneventful. i slept immediately after i came home from school. my mother and brother went to a diwali party next door, and he came home at eight - interrupting my sleep - and asked me to make him something to eat. i made him some food and tried to go back to sleep. i went to sleep around 22 and woke up at 3. i slept again at 6 and woke up to feed the birds at 7.</p> 
              <p>my younger cousin from india called me, i hadn't talked to her in over 2 years. we had a very nice conversation, though she cut out a lot, so i ended up just smiling and laughing most of the time. she made fun of how whitewashed i was. it didn't take it personally, she's not wrong. i don't speak hindi well, and i can only understand up to almost 4th standard level. she's otherwise very sweet. she is a lot like me. she's getting along very well with my father. i hope i get to go to india again and catch up.</p>
              <p>after that i took another nap. i woke up at four. now i have been up since. i was very lazy yesterday. maybe i'll make it up today, or tommorow. who knows.</p>
              <p>my mother and brother went to another party. they haven't come back yet at the time of writing. i helped her get ready. i just stared at her and came to the realization that she was my mother. i get that feeling often where i think, "wow, this woman gave birth to me. she isn't some woman i happen to live with right now." same thing happens with my father too. i have no idea why.</p>
              <p>i found some very interesting sites today and followed them. i also tried to make a new button but it didn't work out. i'll try again later.</p>

            <p>i ordered a new toy and it came today, it's a big green ball with a bell inside. it's more-so meant for parrots but i think it'll be okay for the budgies as well. the bath dish came as well. ray was interested and tried to get to it but he couldn't. i placed a ramp leading up to it, so hopefully one of them gets a chance to try it.</p>
            <p>more toys will be coming tomorrow, along with the cage. i think they are little bored, so as stressful as that will be to them, it will also give them something to do.</p>
            <p>i also got some pellets to give to them as well, so they don't fill up just on seeds alone.</p>

            <p>yesterday me and my brother got budgies. we have a temp cage for them as my dad got a very large one off of amazon.</p>
            <p>i feel a lot of dread..? for some reason..?</p>
            <p>it's probably the responsibility that i'm facing now. i have to take care of a living breathing bird.</p>
            <p>the budgies were actually my moms idea, i don't know how or where she got the idea from (maybe the dove?).</p>

              <p>unfortunately the new cage did not come today.</p>
              <p>they don't have a lot of toys right now and i feel so horrible about it, but at least they have each other. but ray doesn't like chiku touching him.</p>
              <p>the dread is still here, i can't figure out the cause of it. is it because of the responsibility? or is it my inability to accept change?</p>
              <p>i'll try my best. they didn't ask to be rehomed by me.</p>

              <p>a mourning dove was getting hunted by a falcon and ran into my window. she flew so hard she left an imprint.</p>
              <p>she fell to the bottom of our porch, stunned by the impact and bleeding through her ear. her eye was also bloody. my brother and I accompanied her, trying to give her water, but she didn't drink. we layed her down in a sunny patch of grass and left her alone for a bit.</p>
              <p>it seemed that she was getting a bit better, she started to fly and after i identified her she flew on to our roof.</p>
              <p>i was worried that we would find her dead tomorrow but, maybe she'll be alright. or the falcon will come back to finish what it's started.</p>
              <p>i can't imagine being her. so much pain she must be in. it's times like this i wish i didn't have a heart. why am i hurting for a bird so much?</p>
              <p>still, the way her racing heart beat so hard that her body moved, and how even though she was prepared to die, she still flew. there's something meaningful in that.</p>

                <p>i got a 75 on my digital class's test. thought it would be better but it's passing,so.</p>
                <p>tomorrow my campus is closed for Juneteenth, i'm going to get my nails done and hopefully find a new pair of boots/sneakers.</p>
                <p>im going to get them shorter so i can actually type, and a black to red gradient. preparing for halloween if you couldn't tell haha.</p>
                <p>next week is my last week of history, and i'm a lot sadder than i thought i would be. i really like my professor, he's very funny and keeps things factual. although he could ease up on the notes a bit, my hand always starts to hurt in that class. <s>he can't really do anything about that though...</s></p>
                <p>so in preparation, i'm applying for so many jobs (got ghosted by my last job), i need something to keep me busy, but they just won't accept me! how are you going to say <i>"urgently hiring"</i> and yet you ghost me?! ugh, what a pain.</p>

                <p>did my first ever college exams. i got an 83 on my history midterm, a lot better than i was expecting. apparently i wasn't going into detail enough, so i'll have to remember that for the future.</p>
                <p>however, for my other class, i haven't gotten the grades yet. my professor in that class is very much old-school so i'm not surprised by that fact haha.</p>
                <p>i'm really liking college more than highschool, it's a lot quieter. although that could be because it's summer.</p>

                <p>i had my first interview today! i think it went pretty well.</p>
                <p>he asked me a lot more questions than i thought they would, but hopefully i was confident in answering them enough.</p>
                <p>finally feel like i'm catching up to everyone else.</p>

                <p>i've finished my first week of CC!</p>
                <p>since it was the first set of classes, everything has been pretty easy so far.</p>
                <p>history has been the easiest, since most of it has just been just paying attention. and to my benefit the subject is a lot more interesting than i thought it would be! my professor is also chill as hell.</p>
                <p>my other class though, it's a bit harder.</p>
                <p>right now it's fine, but i've been trying to study extra hard for it. i actually didn't really understand what he was talking about in the first half of class which was kind of concerning. luckily, he has all the notes and homework assignments online, so as i long as i remember to study, i should be good!</p>
                <p>i'm really liking this so far, it's keeping me and my mind busy. i hate being bored.</p>

                <p>tomorrow is my first day at a community college.</p>
                <p>my high school offers a dual credit program at a local community college for free, it allows high school students to complete some of their credits needed early. although i'm just going so i can skip some of my classes like u.s history.</p>
                <p>it's pretty nerveracking, but i'm surprised i'm not as anxious as i thought i would be. i'm actually more excited!</p>
                <p>this is definitely going to be good for me, getting used to how college assignments work and all. i'll need this since i'll be taking 6 AP's next year...</p>
                <p>this will also mean more updates to this site(by site i mean this journal/diary)!! yay!!</p>
