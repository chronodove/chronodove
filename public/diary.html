          <h2>5/31 - 20:43</h2>
          <p>i've finished my first week of CC!</p>
          <p>since it was the first set of classes, everything has been pretty easy so far.</p>
          <p>history has been the easiest, since most of it has just been just paying attention. and to my benefit the subject is a lot more interesting than i thought it would be! my professor is also chill as hell.</p>
          <p>my other class though, it's a bit harder.</p>
          <p>right now it's fine, but i've been trying to study extra hard for it. i actually didn't really understand what he was talking about in the first half of class which was kind of concerning. luckily, he has all the notes and homework assignments online, so as i long as i remember to study, i should be good!</p>
          <p>i'm really liking this so far, it's keeping me and my mind busy. i hate being bored.</p>
          <h2>5/27 - 21:18</h2>
          <p>tomorrow is my first day at a community college.</p>
          <p>my high school offers a dual credit program at a local community college for free, it allows high school students to complete some of their credits needed early. although i'm just going so i can skip some of my classes like u.s history.</p>
          <p>it's pretty nerveracking, but i'm surprised i'm not as anxious as i thought i would be. i'm actually more excited!</p>
          <p>this is definitely going to be good for me, getting used to how college assignments work and all. i'll need this since i'll be taking 6 AP's next year...</p>
          <p>this will also mean more updates to this site(by site i mean this journal/diary)!! yay!!</p>
