                        <p>okay turns out i am using twine. i, for the life of me, cannot figure out how inform works. but it's okay.</p>
                        <p>i've yet to complete the whole thing, i've just finished the intro. i know where i am going with the game, all i need to do is write that and some stuff in between. since this is a low stress game jam that goes until april, theres nothing for me to lose. except time.</p>

                        <summary>engine</summary>
                        <p>okay, i think i know what engine i'm going to use. not specifically, but i'll cross that bridge when i get there you know.</p>
                        <p>i am definitely NOT using twine, i am going to use something akin to inform, where the users can type stuff in. i think that much more fun than clicking options.</p>
                        <p>my choices for this are quite limited, there are some niche javascript ones on itch.io, and there's also <b>inform</b> and <b>quest.</b> i'm not a huge fan of quest, it's quite old school, but i might just have to go with that since i can't for the life of me figure out how to use inform. there is also <b>adrift</b> which seems promising.</p>
                        <p>i know what i want my story to be at least. it will be about two girls named sara and the un-named protag. that's all i'll reveal for now ;)</p>

                        <p>i decided i would join the road trip jam today, though it starts in three days. it's relaxed and chill, so it's perfect for me !</p>
                        <p>i'm not sure where i want to go for it, given that the prompt is so vague, but i think i might go for two friends bonding on while on the road, maybe confessing to each other. aaaaa thats so cute !!!!!!</p>
                        <p>it's definitely going to be text-based (i cannot draw), but i'm not sure what engine to use. there are some niche ones on itch & there's also twine. i'm not a very big fan of twine, but it seems like it's my only choice. or i might use inform. i don't know....i'll find something.</p>
