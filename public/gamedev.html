                    <h3>1-19</h3>
                    <p>i decided i would join the road trip jam today, though it starts in three days. it's relaxed and chill, so it's perfect for me !</p>
                    <p>i'm not sure where i want to go for it, given that the prompt is so vague, but i think i might go for two friends bonding on while on the road, maybe confessing to each other. aaaaa thats so cute !!!!!!</p>
                    <p>it's definitely going to be text-based (i cannot draw), but i'm not sure what engine to use. there are some niche ones on itch & there's also twine. i'm not a very big fan of twine, but it seems like it's my only choice. or i might use inform. i don't know....i'll find something.</p>
