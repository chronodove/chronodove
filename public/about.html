  <p>hello, my name is dove. i'm a chronic pessimist and self-loather. i have a lot of thoughts in my head and constantly think all hours of the day. i have things i want to do but no time to do them. the only things i love in this world are naps, the hours where birds and bugs sing, the dwarf planet eris & the colours black and red. when i'm not stressing over my next test, i like to read, write, & browse the web for interesting sites. i also like to listen to rock and vocaloid. my favourite animals are avians and canines. i hope when i am older, i get to wake up and watch the sunrise everyday.</p>
