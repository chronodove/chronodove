    <p>hello, my name is dove. i am a high school senior. i am interested in engineering, marine life, and birds. my birthday is 11/28. i'm from the northern part of the us but moved to the southern part 4 years ago. i plan to move back north for college. i speak english and hindi. i have 2 budgies named <b>aam</b> and <b>kittu.</b></p>
    <p>outside of school and when i have energy, i like to code, read, sew, and crochet. i am not good at any of these, but i still find myself enjoying the time i spend with these crafts.</p>
    <p>i am a big fan of minimalism and simplicty, maximalism and complexity are overwhelming. </p>
