                <h3>11/16</h3>
                <p>was at a weird sort of tree house where if you made too much noise, you'd have to run outside and hide in a bush from a dinosaur like creature. the bathrooms inside the house were very nice and modern.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>11/15</h3>
                <p>had a square cage of budgies and caiques. one of them was dead.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>11/10</h3>
                <p>this takes place in my old neighbourhood, me and an old friend, J were inside in my other friends, JB house. J made fun of me for not wanting to play with her. i said "i'm 17 years old i don't think i would do something like that", i forgot what she said in response, but she was mad at me. then JB asked me what time it was, i said it was 6:03 pm. she said she had to go now(even though we were in her house?) and i followed her. we went outside and i found a white and black budgie in the trees. i grabbed it and went into my house. inside my room, i had a small cage with 5 budgies, my old ones and my brothers + the new one called "oreo". i also had 2 cockatoos. two of the budgies were old and looked sick. one of the cockatoos got out i tried playing with it, i gave it rattan balls and a mini swing. then my alarm woke me up.</p>
                <h3>11/7</h3>
                <p>my face was red and covered in boils and acne. i had a mouths on my forehead. when i tried to remove them, they would stick out their tongues instead. i told my mom but she said just to exfoliate and they would go away.</p>
